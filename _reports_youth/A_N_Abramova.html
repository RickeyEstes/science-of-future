<p>Shown in Fig.1 copper icosahedral small particle (ISP) possess six axes of symmetry of the fifth order, a specific surface morphology with twenty facets of {111}-type crystallographic planes. The internal structure of ISPs is characterized by the presence of twin boundaries, twin lamellae, and disclination defects. Because of disclinations, ISPs demonstrate an enormous amount of stored elastic energy. The peculiarities of ISP structure and large stored energy cause a variety of relaxation processes in the ISPs in temperature and stress fields.

<p>This work presents the results on the influence of the annealing performed under various environmental conditions on the structural and phase transformations in ISPs. In particular, we have identified the internal cavities in the particles as a result of annealing (Fig. 2). The conducted studies are important for developing effective nanocatalysts and sorbent materials based on icosahedral small particles.</p>
