<p>Free oxygen radicals cause oxidative stress in many pathological conditions including eye diseases. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a potent antioxidant enzyme for the treatment of these diseases. Encapsulation of SOD within nanoparticles can enhance its effectiveness due to better permeability across cornea barrier.<br>
We prepared and characterized SOD-containing nanoparticles based on calcium phosphate (CaPh-particles).<br>
X-ray spectroscopy showed that the particle core consisted from amorphous calcium phosphate and crystalline brushite (CaHPO4*2H2O). This finding was confirmed by TEM analysys. SOD-containing CaPh-particles were characterized by the larger size, decreased ζ- potential compared with empty particles, with a high percentage of enzyme inclusion and stability both in solution and in lyophilized state.<br>
We demonstrated that the use of SOD in nanoparticles was more effective than its solution in the treatment of immunogenic uveitis (inflammatory eye disease) in rabbits, decreasing eyelid edema, posterior synechiae and the amount of fibrin clots.<br>
Thus, SOD-CaPh-particles are perspective therapeutic agent for the treatment of uveitis.
