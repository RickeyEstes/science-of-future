<p>Magnetic nanoparticles can be used for nanomechanical control of biochemical properties of macromolecules via low-frequency non-heating magnetic field. It was shown [1] that super-low-frequency magnetic field (50Hz, 137,5 mTl) reduce the rate of enzyme activity of a-chymotrypsin, immobilized on copolymer-MNP aggregates, to 25%. We developed immobilized technique that achieves the less of enzyme activity to 55-60%. Also we studied the effect of AC magnetic field at different frequency and strength.<br>
