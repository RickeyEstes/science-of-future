<p>Application of porous scaffolds with given architectonic and programmed rate of biodegradation is one of the modern and actively developed approaches to tissue engineering. In this work, formation of scaffolds required for neuroimplantation by two-photon laser photo – polymerization technique is reported. The method consists in the manufacture of layered three-dimensional matrix in accordance with computer model. The laser beam is focused in photo-solidified composition and scanned along a predetermined path, thus forming a solid sample. Method enables to obtain scaffolds with high spatial resolution (up to 0.3mm), and to control effectively the porosity of the resulting structure. That makes it very promising for solving the problem of the formation of polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering.</p>
<p>We report here the results of fabrication of scaffolds from hybrid composition containing zirconium using two-photon laser photo-polymerization. Our cell tests demonstrate that scaffollds are non-toxic. Neuronal cells were seeded on scaffolds and demonstrated proliferation and creation of neural networks (within 7 days).</p>

<p>Three-dimensional matrix structures from conductive polymer for neuro-implantation were fabricated using combination of two-photon laser photo – polymerization and oxidative polymerization in two component medium comprising a photosensitive matrix and the conductive polymer precursor. Microstructures with conductivity of 0.04 S/cm were obtained.</p>
