<p>Optical biosensors possess high sensitivity and permits detection and the quantitative analysis of chemical and biological samples. Presented work is directed on development and optimization of the new principles of detection and the device design of the miniaturized biosensor devices for clinical diagnostics on the basis of the photonic crystal waveguides combining a role of solid substrate for placement of sensitive elements and wave guides for transfer of optical signals. Besides actually substrate carrier, photonic crystal carries out a role of the optical filter, "cutting out" target optical signals at the expense of modelled by production of "transparency windows".<br>
As labels luminescent CdSe/ZnS quantum dots of different emission colors are used. For modification of a surface of photonic crystal waveguides a layer-by-layer (LbL) adsorption of opposite charged polyelectrolytes is applied.<br>
