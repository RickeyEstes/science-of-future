<p>The work concerns bending of sloping rectangular in plan shell with positive Gaussian curvature made of different resistant material. The problem is being resolved using two-step method of perturbation of parameters. Differential equations that appear during the process are being resolved using method of finite differences with standard accuracy level (h2). All mentioned above is being calculated on PC using MATLAB. Polymer composite ATJ-S is taken as a test material, suffering distributed load. The results received from resolving similar problem in view of classic theory using ANSYS are being used for comparison.</p>
<p>Given received results and experimental data, we can be positive that considering different resistance greatly influences the accuracy of calculation of some parameters of stress and strain state.</p>
