<p>The main advantage of MSW devices is the planar technology, diminutiveness and controllability by a magnetic field in a wide range of frequencies [1,2]. In spite of the evident advantages, the practical applications of the proposed devices were impeded by the problem of the frequency thermostabilization. In this work [3], we study the possibilities of self-compensation of the frequency’s temperature drift in spin-wave ferrite devices using reversible thermal demagnetization of permanent magnets. The normal magnetization of the YIG film are considered. The YIG film resonator was used for thermal stabilization. For a normal magnetization of isotropic YIG films, the film’s frequency of a fundamental mode is approximately equal to the lower frequency of the MSW spectrum. By application of different types of rare-earth magnets, a stabilization system was tuned to the desired thermostabilized frequency. Fig.1 demonstrates the experimental temperature dependence of the frequency for the oscillator based on the normal magnetized YIG film.</p>

<p>The proposed method provides increased thermal stability without using of complicated thermostat systems. This system can be widely used for planar spin-wave microwave devices.</p>
