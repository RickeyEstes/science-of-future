<p>The kinetics of the process and the quality of the product obtained in heterogeneous processes are largely dependent on the specific surface of the solid phase and sorbents.
A measuring device for rapid control of this parameter has been designed in the process, porosity and specific surface of activated carbons used as a sorbent when extracting gold from solutions and slurries has been studied.
The economic effect of the development is achieved by accelerating the analysis and getting opportunity in pace with the process to make a correction signal APCS. Besides the rejection of glass fittings, pressure vessels, using of liquefied gas as a refrigerant improves safety in operation. Low cost of the analysis is provided by reducing the measurement time by 3-4 times, while ensuring basic relative error which does not exceed ± 5% (Table 1).
The grading will be based on state standard samples of the specific surface. The calibration interval is 1 year.
