<p>Microcapsules are relatively new type of structures, consisting polyelectrolyte layers around an internal part of microcapsule, which could be empty, or it could by nanoparticle of different nature, soluble or non-soluble. Preparation of microcapsules occurs by sequential adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes on the surface of particles. Capsules are spherical or irregular in shape, ranging in size from 1 to 2000 micrometers, containing solid or liquid active substances. Microcapsules are widely used in biotechnology, chemical and diagnostic purposes as carriers of biological substances for controlled delivery and release of the encapsulated material and as microcontainers for performing chemical reactions in a limited volume. However, for some purposes control over the process of degradation of the microcapsules is necessary. As a new strategy for studying of microcapsules stability under different conditions and degradation processes the inclusion of luminescent quantum dots of various colours into different parts of capsules was used. The experiments tested the stability and permeability of the polyelectrolyte shells and release of the encapsulated material under different external influences</p>
