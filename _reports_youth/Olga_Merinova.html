Aluminum that is found in almost any natural water ranks third by its crustal abundance [1]. Until the mid of the last century, aluminum was considered to be an inactive metal. Nowadays the scientists reliably show that it has diverse toxic effects in humans and animals [2,3,4]. Therefore, to improve the quality of drinking water, we must seek for the ways of elimination of undesirable effect of aluminum at the stage of water treatment. One of the most efficient solutions to this problem is sorption water treatment by active carbons [5]. The purpose of our work was to study aluminum sorption on activated carbons for choosing the most effective sorbent to be used for advanced treatment of drinking water before its supply to consumers.<br>
