<p>Quantum dots are tiny nanocrystals of a semiconducting material with diameters in the range of 2-10 nanometers; they are widely used in optics, electronics and technique. For bioapplication quantum dots have to form stable colloid water solution. One of ideas to stabilize initially hydrophobic quantum dots in water solutions is to include them into carrier structures, for example, liposomes. The spherical double-layer structure of liposomes allows encapsulation of multiple water-insoluble quantum dots, provides luminescence signal amplification and easy conjugation with proteins. Surface silica coverage ensures the stability of liposomes loaded with quantum dots during storage and application. These nanostructures were synthesized, characterized and employed as luminescent labels in immunoassay. It was shown that silica covered liposomes loaded with quantum dotsallowed a significant increase of label stability (comparing with non-covering liposomes) while maintaining the assay’s sensitivity</p>
