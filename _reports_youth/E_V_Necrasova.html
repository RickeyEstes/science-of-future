<p>Research of snow cover on availability of pollutants is the major task when carrying out ecogeochemical monitoring of the territory of the city. Pollutants are preserved in snow cover to a spring migratory cycle. The chemical analysis of snow allows to predict structure of future migrants in various natural objects of city landscapes and to prevent their distribution. The special part in an assessment of an ecological state of environment of the cities is assigned to studying of influence of deicing reagents. Interest to them increases in connection with emergence of sharp toxiferous effects.<br>
The research objective is definition of components of anti-icing reagents in snow cover, an assessment of dynamics of their using and identification of extent of pollution of the urbanized territory taking into account influence of natural and anthropogenous factors the example of Tyumen winter periods 2012-2013 and 2013-2014.<br>
Exemplars were divided into a liquid phase and a dust component for receiving reliable results. Comparison of results of monitoring 2013 and 2014 showed that the average Na and Ca ion concentration in 2014 decreased by 3 times, and Mg and Cl twice.Areas of distribution and accumulation of pollutants in 2013 and 2014 significantly differ (fig. 1. pollution schemes on the example of a magnesium ion).<br>
The studies show that the snow is reliable integrated indicator of pollution in urban areas in the winter. Using the method of chemical analysis of snow reveals the ecological state of the city and look for ways to deal with anthropogenic pollutants.<br>
*The study was supported by a project of the Tyumen State University aimed at executing Resolution 220 of the Government of the Russian Federation, and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project no. 14-05-00956-a)
