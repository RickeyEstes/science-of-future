<p>A number of technological complexes for melting, casting and annealing glasses and glass-ceramics was developed and produced and successfully operates in our laboratory. They have become a solution for the current state of the market where small amounts of special glasses are required but their nomenclature is increasing. Applying the principles of optical glass manufacture enabled developing a number of novel optically homogeneous materials such as laser and magnetooptical glasses, light filters and optical converters, glass ceramic materials with unique properties as well as glasses for nuclear medicine. Technological equipment of the laboratory allows us obtaining glass samples of industrial quality even at the stage of laboratory research. That both accelerates the development of technology in the industry and enhances fundamental research. In the laboratory, radiation resistant glass tape for solar cells protection in space and glass microspheres for cancer brachytherapy have been developed and are being produced now. Students and young researchers play a great role in the described activities and all listed strategies allow commercialization.</p>
