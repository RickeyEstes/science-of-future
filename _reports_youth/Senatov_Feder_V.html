<p>In recent years, there is a trend to increase the role of implant surgery. In particular, clinical situations often occur where major traumas, congenital malformations or diseases result in need for reconstruction of defects of cartilage and bone. In this work biocompatible polymer composites perspective for bone and cartilage replacement were studied.<br><br>
UHMWPE-based composites for cartilage and bone reconstruction were developed. UHMWPE scaffolds for bone reconstruction have high ductility in compression and bending, porosity of 60 – 80 % vol. with pore size: 100 - 800 microns. Number of fusion defects was reduced in case of UHMWPE for cartilage replacement. Such UHMWPE structures have high impact strength, high wear-resistance (wear is reduced in 3 times) and low coefficient of friction (friction in water 0.06), biocompatibility, bioresistance.<br><br>
