<p>PbZr1−xTixO3 (PZT) is a solid solution of lead titanate PbTiO3 and lead zirconate PbZrO3. PZT is well-known and a commonly used material, used in a wide variety of technological applications. The PZT with low concentration of Ti undergoes two phase transitions: ferroelectric and antiferroelectric one. Paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition is accompanied by the appearance of the superlattice M-type reflections ½(h k 0). Electron diffraction studies of ferroelectric phase have revealed the existence of the M-reflections splitting for PZT with high concentration of Zr [1]. At the moment corresponding structure modulation is not understood completely. PZT single crystals X-ray diffraction at Ti concentrations 0,7%, 1,5% and 3,3% has been studied on Swiss-Norwegian beamline of European synchrotron radiation source. Diffraction measurements revealed the appearance of strong anisotropic diffuse scattering around Bragg spots. The splitting of M-superstructure was observed.
