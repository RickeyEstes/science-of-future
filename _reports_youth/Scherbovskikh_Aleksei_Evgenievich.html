<p>Evaluated the biological compatibility of nonvowen titanium material with a through porosity on culture of multipotent mesenchimal stromal cells. Testing was carried out using multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells under 2 passages in vitro. Total time cultivation of cell cultures was 27 days. From 6 to 27 days of the experiment the cells reached 95 % of monolayer coverage on the surface of culture plastic in the test and control groups, showed positive dynamics of increase in the number of cells in the lumen pores and on the surface of the material in the test group. Visual proportion of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in the study and control groups appeared to be equal. Experimentally proved the biocompatibility of titanium nonwoven material with a though porosity obtained using the method of cold pressing on the culture of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells.</p>
