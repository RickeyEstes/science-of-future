<p>Viscoelastic composite structures have complex nonstationary loads during exploitation. The study of these loads leads to need to improve methods of determining the dynamic deformation properties of materials.</p>
<p>Scientific work is devoted to research behavior of viscoelastic material under biharmonic load. The method of complex operators was chosen for description of dynamic deformation properties of viscoelastic materials under stationary harmonic loads.</p>
<p>Special method was developed to determine the dynamic deformation properties of viscoelastic materials under biharmonic load. The developed method allows to determine the dynamic modulus and the loss angle for each harmonic.</p>
<p>Research material behavior under various parameters and load conditions (frequency, strain amplitude, temperature) were conducted. It was found that the frequency, strain amplitude and temperature influence on the behavior of viscoelastic material [10-12].</p>
<p>The work was carried out in the Perm National Research Polytechnic University with support of the Government of Russian Federation (The decree № 220 on April 9, 2010) under the Contract № 14.В25.310006, on June 24, 2013.</p>
