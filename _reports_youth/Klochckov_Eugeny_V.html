<p>This article describes trends in the development of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles and how it is important for the development of science, and to improve the defense capabilities of our Navy. Was reviewed history of the emergence and development of the classical autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles and a comparison of their basic characteristics. Later in the article describes the underwater gliders, they differ from classical AUV, advantages and disadvantages, comparison of the characteristics of several models of underwater gliders. Also considered bionic autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles and their features, advantages and prospects. There is information about the major scientific and commercial organizations involved in the development of underwater vehicles, participation of different countries in the production of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles. In the last part of this article discussed the prospects for the development of autonomous unmanned underwater vehicles, such as new materials, new types of propulsion and batteries, the creation of new concepts and ideas for the AUV, broader applications autonomous underwater vehicles for commercial, scientific and military purposes.</p>
