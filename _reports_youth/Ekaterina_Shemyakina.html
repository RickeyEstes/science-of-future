<p>The energy calibration of nuclear recoil detectors is of primary importance to rare-event experiments such as those of direct dark matter search and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. In particular, such a calibration is performed by measuring the ionization yield of nuclear recoils in liquid Ar and Xe detection media, using neutron elastic scattering off nuclei. The ionization yield for nuclear recoils in liquid Ar has for the first time been measured in the higher energy range, at 80 and 233 keV, using a two-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detector (CRAD) and DD neutron generator. The ionization yield in liquid Ar at an electric field of 2.3 kV/cm amounted to 7.8+/-1.1 and 9.7+/-1.3 e-/keV at 80 and 233 keV respectively. Neither Jaffe model for nuclear recoil-induced ionization nor that of Thomas-Imel can consistently describe the energy dependence of the ionization yield.</p>
