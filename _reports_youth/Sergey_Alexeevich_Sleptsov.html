<p>This article considers the possibility of arranging the power supply of modern domesticelectrical appliances in DC-mode, by estimating the main advantages and disadvantages of this approach. The urgency of the problem becomes apparent when comparing the technical and economic indicators of the two similar projects with the different modes of power supply (DC and AC). Because of their physical features (absence of reactive power, harmonics, proximity and skin effects), DC systems seem to be more favorable in many cases. An additional pro for the DC-systems can be their effective implementation in networks with renewable sources. Besides, practically in every modern appliance AC input voltage is converted into DC to be later used by various electronic circuits to provide the necessary product qualities. Of course, the transition to DC power supply will meet a lot of difficulties, such as the necessity of using special outlets for the unambiguous polarity, modernization of transmission systems, the use of special types of fuses and similar, but they are all solvable.</p>
