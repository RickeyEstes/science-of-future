<p>Nitride nuclear fuel is attractive for fast breeder reactors and reactors for spacecraft. The development of this type of fuel has been conducted around the world since the 60s of the last century. At the same time, its properties have been less studied than, for example, those of the oxide and carbide fuels. This was related to difficulties in obtaining dense uranium nitride. The fabrication of dense compacts usually requires processing under temperatures above 2073 K for several hours. However, high temperature sintering leads to decomposition and separation of the uranium nitride phase in treated samples. In the present work, the opportunity of the consolidation of uranium nitride tablets by high voltage electric discharge consolidation (HVEDC) is considered. It is shown that the consolidation by HVEDC allows the prevention of the expansion of uranium nitride powders and renders pellets with relative density of up to 97 %. The thermal stability of the obtained samples has been investigated. The analysis of the microstructure of the processed samples indicates the retention of the initial powder structure.</p>
