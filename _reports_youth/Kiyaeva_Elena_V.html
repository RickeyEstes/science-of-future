<p>The element status and morphological changesofcerebrum tissues and kidneys of laboratory animals (male Wistar rats, n=20, weighing 180-200 grams) are studied at simultaneous influence of ethanol and cadmium.Material was subjected to histologic and morphometric research.In the blood of the laboratory animals who were affected by ethanol and cadmium, decrease in the contents of Mg, P, As, Fe, Cu, Si, Zn is revealed and the concentration of Cd is increased. The morphofunctional changes show destructive and degenerate processes in rats' brain under the influence of toxic elements. It is established that in skilled group about 65% nephrons are exposed to destruction with microheart attacks.<br><br>
The study was supported by the Ministry of education of the Orenburg region in 2014 (the project â„– 36)
