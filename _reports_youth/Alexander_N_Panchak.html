<p> The Intermediate band solar cells (IBSC) contains a band within the forbidden band of a semiconductor (the IB) that serves as a stepping stone to absorb additional low-energy photons and increases the efficiency. </p>
<p>The transitions between each couple of confined electronic states induced by the QDs are characterized by a Dirac delta. However this delta is widened by the dispersion of sizes of the QDs involved. In preceding works this widening has been considered equal for all the transitions. In this work we calculate the widening for each transition by calculating the position of the energy levels in QDS with their average size of the base side and with sizes that have been augmented and decreased in an amount equal to the standard deviation. </p>
