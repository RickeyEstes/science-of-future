<p>Young's modulus and shear modulus of soft biological tissue are important diagnostic parameters for medical applications involving the detection of tumors and other abnormalities (eg, fibrosis) in the early stages of the disease. The most promising method for experimental determination of the shear modulus and Young's modulus of soft tissue is to excite the shear wave locally in the region of interest for the study and measure its speed. The described technique is called Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI). The report presents the results of measurements of the shear modulus of gelatin phantoms and calibrated polymer phantom CIRS - Model 049A Elasticity QA performed on the Verasonics research ultrasound system (Laboratory "MedLab") and ultrasound machine Siemens Acuson S2000 (Department of Radiological Diagnostics of VDMC). Experiment studies show good agreement between the results.</p>
