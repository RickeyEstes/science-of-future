<p>Ten years ago an effect of formation of periodic nanostructures (nanogratings) inside fused silica under irradiation of the femtosecond laser were revealed. Their crucial feature is birefringence, depending on the beam polarization and power which enables their application for “everlasting” optical 5D-memory. Investigating possibility of obtaining such nanogratings in materials other than silica glass we obtained femtosecond laser-induced local birefringence inside titanium-silicate glass (8,6% TiO2 and 91,4% SiO2 (wt.%)). According to literature data, this birefringence relates with formation of nanogratings. Lines and dots with polarization-dependent local birefringence are written inside the glass. During the experiment influence of laser irradiation parametres on features of birefringence areas were studied. Minimal number of pulses for formation local birefringence areas inside titanium-silicate glass is shown similar to that for silica glass.</p>
