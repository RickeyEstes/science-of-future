<p>Scientific novelty of the design is to create a mobile mobile system for remote monitoring of the environmental and related studies using small UAVs in order to predict the state of the environmental quality of urban and mining-industrial agglomerations, taking into account the defined list of pollutants and their migration patterns in the components environment (patent number 2,471,209). <br><br>
Created an innovative monitoring system based on the use of modern measurement systems installed on unmanned aerial aircraft and helicopter types. Efficiency remote monitoring system is ensured by dual channel radio radius of 20 km in real time between UAVs and ground control station with special software, which is held input, control and, if necessary, edit the route of flight, as well as treatment of the results . <br><br>
Specially designed aircraft, part of the payload and its configuration methods are unique domestic developments and have no analogues in Russia and known counterparts abroad.
