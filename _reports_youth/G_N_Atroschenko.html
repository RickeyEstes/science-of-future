<p>The most promising glass compositions that can be used for treating oncological diseases by local radiotherapy are identified. The microspheres of yttrium aluminosilicate (YAS) glass with a high content of Y2O3 (up to 23 mol.%) are developed and patented. The YAS microspheres passed the toxicological, radiological and clinical trials. The microspheres based on YAS glass with isotopes 177Lu and 166Ho with the surface nano-or microlayer, that does not contain a radioactive isotope were obtained. An experimental industrial line of melting, glass working, grinding, size distribution and spheroidizing of glass for nuclear medicine was created. The technology can be used to produce a wide variety of microspheres for nuclear medicine. The laboratory is the only one Russian developer and manufacturer of glassy microspheres and able to satisfy needs of medicine. Work of the laboratory was awarded grand prix of the III International Forum on Intellectual Property and the gold medal of the XIII International Forum "High Technologies of the XXI Century".</p>
