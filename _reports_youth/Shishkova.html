<p>The most important property of supported catalysts is the distribution of the active component of grain carrier.Thus, at high flow rates of processes the reaction proceeds only in a thin surface layer, it is of interest to study the distribution of a focused control active ingredient. For carriers with through well wettable pores dipping method is used, with the pore filling solution is mainly due to capillary forces transfer In the example of impregnation cylindrical granules of γ-A12O3 by nickel nitrate solution set speed increase promotion solution deep into the capillary of grains: shown that pre-filling of the pores with a solvent (water) reduces the rate of progress, presumably due to changes in the mechanism of capillary impregnation by diffusion; calculated values ​​of the diffusion coefficient (D - (2.0 - 2.7) x10-10m2/s. Found that when the solution temperature rises from 25 to 42 ° C; impregnation rate increases 1.8 times.Similar results were obtained spherical granules.</p>
