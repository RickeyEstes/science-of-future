<p>Relevance of experimental studies of the mechanical properties of fibers and fabrics due to the need for early stage in the design of products and structures made of composite materials to know the laws of deformation and fracture, as well as mechanical properties of reinforcing components. The aim of this work is to obtain experimental data showing the basic laws of deformation and fracture mechanisms yarns and fabrics.</p>
<p>This paper proposes an integrated approach to the study to determine the characteristics of the reinforcing elements composites. Yarns and fabrics were investigated by static stretching, breaking, impact strength and elongation of the fiber material web. Test procedures were developed with the advice of existing standards for testing yarns and fabrics, and features modern test equipment.</p>
<p>In this paper have been implemented and the test strips of fiberglass glass fiber tensile than at check-destruction processes fiberglass tape is accomplished by the use of non-contact three-dimensional digital optical system and the Vic-3D digital image correlation method. To achieve the goal proposed comprehensive study of the properties of reinforcing elements in the implementation of impact tests on tissue samples to material on a spinning cloth and impact strength. Strain diagramobtained, analyzed the results.</p>
