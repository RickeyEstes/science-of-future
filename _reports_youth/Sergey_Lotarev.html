<p>Femtosecond laser-induced space-selective crystallization of glasses is an efficient technique of fabricating microfeatures for prospective active elements of novel glass-based devices for integrated optics and photonics. Crystal growth induced by a femtosecond laser in glasses requires cumulative heating effect and has been reported only for laser beams with a pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz and higher. We for the first time report growth of crystalline dots and continuous quasi-single-crystalline lines of ferroelectric LaBGeO5 phase in 25La2O3-25B2O3-50GeO2 (mol.%) glass by means of femtosecond laser irradiation at different repetition rate below 100 kHz. Minimal repetition rate sufficient for crystal growth has been shown to be 9 kHz for dots and about 25 kHz for quasi-single-crystalline lines using femtosecond pulses at 1030 nm with energy up to 120 Î¼J and duration of 290 fs. Optimal irradiation conditions for obtaining smooth crystalline lines are also reported.</p>
