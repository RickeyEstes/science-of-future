<p>A research for development an optimal in-place pipe’s internal surface processing technology was pursued in 2013. Consequently there were found a technology, a process scheme, and an equipment for this type of work. As a process scheme for hole-making operations there was accepted a honing operation scheme. For the processing stimulation honing process is made with electrochemical process together. This compound action on the hole allows to achieve a low value of surface contour (Ra=3-4 micron) and to recover from remaining deposits on the pipe’s internal surface which can deteriorate service characteristics of the pipes. Figure 1 shows photos of a pipe before and after in-place processing. The pipe is located in the furnace of the unit 123 in the Oil Factory territory which belongs to Angarsk Fuel and Petrochemical Refinery.</p>
