<p>New directions for the development and use of advanced mobile technologies to enhance the effectiveness of the ecologically problems solution, in particular to reduce the negative impact of pollution, such as air space per person was proposed.<br>
Work is devoted to the development of systems and software for mobile phone (smartphone) to display environmental information on a map of the city and improve the efficiency of prevention and diagnosis of ecologically caused diseases.<br>
In this paper we solve the following tasks.<br>
1. Prompt the user to obtain information about air pollution at the location and in the rest of the city.<br>
2. Improving the efficiency of prevention and diagnosis of ecologically caused diseases a particular person by assessing the concentration and duration of the negative impact of air pollution on human based on the use developed fuzzy models.<br>
3. Issuance of recommendations for prevention of ecologically caused diseases a particular person due to the analysis of the accumulated count and comparison with the analysis results of heart rate variability.</p>
