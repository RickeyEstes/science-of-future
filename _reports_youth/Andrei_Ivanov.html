<p>The article is devoted to a novel numerical method for integration of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The key idea of the approach is to build a numerical nonlinear matrix map that corresponds to the solution of ODEs. The method has enormous performance advantages in compare with traditional step-by-step integration schemes. The first part of the article corresponds to the proposed algorithm of nonlinear matrix map building derivation. In the second one the verification of the method is preceded.</p>
