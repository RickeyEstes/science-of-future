<p>The famous 'edge of the wedge' theorem (N. N. Bogolubov 1956 [1]) asserts that if f(z) is a function holomorphic in a tubular domain Τ=Rn+iΓ, whose base Γ is the two-sided light cone y12>y22+ ... +yn2, and continuous in its closure, then f(z) admits an analytic continuation in Cn.</p>
<p>In [2] S.I.Pinchuk generalized Bogolubov`s result taking instead of the light cone an arbitrary wedge with the edge on a generating manifold bounded by smooth hypersurfaces in general position. In the paper [3] we studied the problem of holomorphic extension of functions into a neighborhood of the edge of a two-sided n-circled wedge in nongeneral position.</p>
<p>Analyzing the ideas of the proof in [3] we find out that in some cases the 'edge of the wedge' theorems could be interpreted as a question of an extension of sheafs.</p>
<p>Let Δ be a disjoint union of compact completely real manifolds Mrn that are subset of Cn, r>0. Denote</p>
<p>Δ* = r≠ 1 Mrn.</p>
<p>Assume that Δ is a fibering into holomorphic curves</p>
<p>lu={z:χj(z,u)=0, j=1,... ,n-1}, u is in Tn-1.</p>
<p>Theorem Let O(Δ*) be a sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions on Δ*. If its holomorphic section f extends continuously on M1n then f extends to a holomorphic section of the sheaf O(Δ).</p>
