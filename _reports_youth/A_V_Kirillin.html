<p>Now the concept of acceptable risk has taken a stable position in problems of safety management. Besides the new direction - risk management has started to develop. As the risk has a probability character, all methods of the impact analysis of catastrophic failures transmitted from a reliability theory to operation of systems in the theory of risk management. These methods have preventive character and ensure admissible risk rate at a design stage. However in a number of problems of potentially dangerous engineering systems safety management security and confirmation to requests of the maximum permissible risk rate probability up to 10-6â€¦10-8is required. Such requests can be confirmed only with the use of statistical mathematical simulation and tools of modern computer facilities. However the classical statistical theory does not decide problems with midget probabilities. In existing normative documents any evaluation procedures of such probabilities are also not regulated. Therefore research and creation of methods and algorithms of "measurement" of midget risk rates is a new actual problem. In the article perspective directions of a solution of this problem on an example of airplanes automatic landing systems correspondence confirmation to standards of the air validity are revealed.</p>
