<p>Pipelines requires maintenance to ensure that the product is safely and efficiently transported. Source of information on the technical condition of the pipelines is internal diagnostics using defect detectors system, moving with the flow of the pumped product.</p>
<p>The principle of operation of the magnetic defect detector system lies in the magnetization of the section pipeline permanent magnetic field to a state of deep saturation and subsequent measurement of the parameters of the magnetic field near the surface of the test section.</p>
<p>This paper presents the optimization design and engineering study of the magnetic system with permanent magnets pig flaw longitudinal magnetization for pipes 8 ". Also in the study, we investigated the effect of motion of the magnetic pig flaw in the form of signals from defects such as corrosion at different speeds.</p>
