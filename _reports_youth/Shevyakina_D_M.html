<p>Laser-induced structural modification of glasses has recently attracted much attention. This technique enables formation of a nano- or a microstructure in the bulk or at the surface of glasses. One of the most important nonlinear optical materials for photonics is a ferroelectric lithium niobate crystal. Honma et al. [1] have succeeded in patterning LiNbO3 crystal lines on the surface of Li2O-Nb2O5-SiO2 (LNS) glass doped by laser light absorbers (CuO and Sm2O3) using Yb laser at 1080 nm. We showed possibility of local surface crystallization of LNS glass without any additives by UV irradiation. A sum frequency line of the copper vapor laser (271 nm) was used for laser heating. The morphology of the irradiated areas was studied by using a polarization optical microscopy. Ablation, refractive index change and precipitation of microscrystals generating a second harmonic were demonstrated. Micro-Raman spectroscopy proved that precipitated crystals belong to LiNbO3 phase.</p>
