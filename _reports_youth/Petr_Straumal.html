<p>Properties of nanocrystalline metallic materials such as: mechanical, magnetic and other became object of high interest and detailed study. It has been widely demonstrated that severe plastic deformation techniques can lead to the formation of nanostructured metals and alloys. Phase transitions and transformations occur during such deformation, depending on the phase diagram of the particular alloy.</p>
<p>We studied the phase equilibrium shift in severe plastic deformed alloys based on copper, alloyed with chromium, hafnium and silver. The phase equilibrium shift under severe plastic deformation has been recently discovered and is yet not enough studied. We propose that the concept of “effective” temperature for the driven or forced systems originally developed by G. Martin for the severe neutron irradiation may be successfully applied to the phase formation processes during SPD. In particular, the effective temperature can be estimated using the equilibrium phase diagram of the respective system.</p>
<p>The phase equilibrium shift under severe plastic deformation will allow to design new functional hybrid and nanomaterials with a combination of phase composition and structure that have been earlier not reachable for conventional technologies.</p>
