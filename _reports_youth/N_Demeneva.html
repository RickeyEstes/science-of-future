<p>In this paper we presented advanced metal bipolar plates with protective coatings are developed for electrolyte-supported SOFC with electrolyte dimensions 50*50 mm2. To protect the surface from the oxidation a cost-effectivetechnique is used. This method consists of Ni-based compound deposition on the stainless steel with a subsequent treatment at elevated temperatures that leads to the chromium barrier layer formation under the surface. Low ASR values of the Crofer 22APU coated samples, about 5-6 mOhm/cm2, were measured over 24 000 hours on the cathode side conditions. The results showed that the electrical resistance variations of the assemblies “Crofer 22 APU | LSM” with and without protective coatings can be quantitatively described in framework of the Schottky barrier model for metal– semiconductor interfaces.</p>
