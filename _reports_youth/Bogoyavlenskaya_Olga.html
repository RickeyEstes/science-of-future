<p>One of the interesting problems of differential geometry is to construct complete G2 holonomy metrics. The main idea is to consider standard conical metric on a Riemannian manifold with a special geometry and then deform it using some functional parameters. Then the condition that the metric has the holonomy group contained in G2 is equivalent to the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We analyzed all possible boundary conditions for this system and found new topological type of spaces with G2 holonomy metrics.</p>
