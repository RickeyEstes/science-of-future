<p>Presented are the results of studying the growth peculiarities of InAs binary compounds and InxGa1-xAs solid solutions on GaAs wafers by MOVPE depending on a number of technological parameters: temperature (in the range of 480 – 700 oC), the ratio of the V and III group atoms in the gas phase (V/III-ratio) and substrate misorientation. Based on analysis of photoluminescence spectra of InxGa1-xAs quantum wells the dependence of In composition in InxGa1-xAs solid solution on the gas phase composition and the dependence of InAs growth rate on In molar flow were calculated.</p>
<p>The obtained data were used for the growth of InAs quantum dots (QDs) by Stranski-Krastanov mode on GaAs surface. Three-dimensional growth mode of GaAs was investigated and the conditions provided the planar surface for deposition both of single-layer InAs QDs and QD arrays with a small number of defects were found. The analysis of PL spectra at different temperatures and excitation levels showed a bimodal distribution of QDs that can be effectively used in the design of solar cells with QDs in the active area.</p>
<p>The investigations are carried out in the frame of Megagrant № 14.B25.31.0020.</p>
