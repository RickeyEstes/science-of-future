<p>For plants unlike animals, a reticulate evolution is typical. In natural conditions sustainable interspecies (or even intergeneric) hybrids often appear. Frequently such species with hybrid origin in isolation conditions develops independently, carrying in themselves phenotype features of the both parents, thus it is impossible by classical morphological methods to reveal basic principles of the taxa development. Research of samples Woodsia calcarea from Russia with strong polymorphism of morphological signs (1 population from Ural, 4 from Khakassia) with the use of RAPD-PCR has been made. 79 polymorphic RAPD-signs have been revealed.<br><br>
Analysis with the help of basic components (Joliffe, 1986) in program NTSYS 2.1 (Applied Biostatistics, Inc.) showed the division of all samples on two groups according to a geographical principle of distribution. Reviled RAPD-analysis has allowed revealing of geographical logic in formation of a complex of isolated forms Woodsia calcarea. Two groups of genetically isolated populations have been reliably reviled: Ural population and hakassian populations Woodsia calcarea.
