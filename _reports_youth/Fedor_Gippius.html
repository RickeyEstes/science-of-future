<p>This work is focused on wind-induced waves on the Black Sea. Parameters of waves were calculated by means of the third-generation spectral wind-wave model SWAN on a 5x5 km rectangular grid. Parameters necessary for the calculations were derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for the period between 1948 and 2010. The time step of this data is 6 hours. The time step of calculations was of 30 minutes. The data massive obtained during calculations permitted to derive several characteristics of the wave regime typical for the Black Sea. The average significant wave height does not exceed 0.7 m. Areas with most expressed storminess are located in the north-eastern and south-western parts of the sea – maximal calculated significant wave heights, lengths and periods correspond to them. Synoptic atmospheric processes leading to storms at the Black Sea were also analyzed. Two typical conditions leading to the generation of storm waves were derived. The first is a fast movement of a Mediterranean cyclone or its trough toward the Black Sea and, at the same time, a large and stable anticyclone over Eastern Europe. The second – an abrupt quasi-meridional intrusion of a cyclone or a trough from the north. Interannual storminess trends for the hindcast period were derived. These trends are in generally slightly negative, but significant variations on scales of tenths of years can be determined. For example, a rise of storminess is observed approximately between 1963 and 1975.</p>
