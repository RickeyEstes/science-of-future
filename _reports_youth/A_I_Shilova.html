<p>Methods of integrated experimental study of mechanical properties, strength, and durability fiber reinforced polymers taking into account special aspects of using test systems, measuring and diagnostic equipment are developed and analyzed at the premises of Center of Experimental Mechanics Perm National Research Polytechnic University (CEM PNRP).</p>
<p>In this work, the experimental research program of composite laminates strength properties under multi-axial stress state is suggested. Methods of composites behavior study under combined quasistatic, cyclic, and dynamic loading are developed and tested. According to these methods, composite material sample is preloaded by non-destructive cyclic/dynamic loads, and then carried to failure by quasistatic loading. The methods of composite laminates durability evaluation during impact tests are proved.</p>
<p>Study method of impact temperature cycling condition on mechanical properties of composite materials and structures is tied out. According to this method, composite material tests are carried out with preliminary temperature cycling, that simulates material or structure work under actual operating conditions. These experiments are conducted on unidirectional basalt fiber reinforced polymer samples.</p>
<p>The method of damage evaluation based on mechanical tests and acoustic emission monitoring is developed. According to this method, mechanical experiments are conducted with recording acoustic emission signals during tests. After experiments, the parametric analysis of the data is carried out. According to this analysis, special aspects of material behavior during test are highlighted.</p>
<p>The work was carried out in the Perm National Research Polytechnic University with support of the Government of Russian Federation (The decree №220 on April 9, 2010) under the Contract №14.B25.31.0006, on June 24, 2013.</p>
