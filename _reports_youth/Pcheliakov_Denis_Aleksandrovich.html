<p>An innovative pressure-assisted flash-sintering technique has been developed to investigate the effect of DC electric field on the sintering behavior of titanium dioxide. There are numerous applications for titanium dioxide in ceramics including microeletronics, glass ceramics, refractive materials, structural ceramics and titanium-containing ceramic materials and chemical intermediates. The traditional sintering of titanium dioxide usually requires several hours at about 1000°C. The conducted research indicates that titanium dioxide can be sintered to full density in only a few seconds at 600-1000°C, when subjected to a DC electrical field above a certain critical processing threshold.</p>
