<p>Presented are results of long-term monitoring research on Greenhouse gases (GHG) seasonal changes, daily dynamics and the main factors influencing their fluxes, obtained in the framework of the Moscow Research Station of the regional GHG monitoring system RusFluxNet. Developing research is unique for the European territory of Russia, and their minimum footprint area size is incomparable in the world. Average CO2 fluxes vary from 7.13 to 29.8 g CO2 m-2 day-1. The daily dynamics of soil CO2 emission depends on the daily dynamics of air temperature (r=0.86). However, by the middle of the season it drops to 0.52 and at the end of the season to 0.38. Seasonal N2O fluxes change from 0.59 to 1.86 mg N2O m-2 day-1. Fixed regularities of the soil temperature and moisture influence on the GHG flux dynamics allow us to predict GHG changes in regional and season scales, taking into attention the specifics of major crops and agrotechnologies of the Central region of Russia.</p>
