<p>In general, the spatial nR linkage with one degree of freedom (DOF) has a wide application, due to its simple controllable. The use of 2-DOF linkages at the construction of devices is difficult causes its structural synthesis and analysis. This work presents the type synthesis of 2-DOF spatial 5R linkage based on Bennett’s linkage. The main idea is based on method named as “fixed joint”. The method consists of 2 parts. Firstly, we take spatial 4R linkage with 1-DOF and transform fixed link to the movable link. Secondly, in this linkage we transform any movable joint to the fixed joint (fig. 1). Thus we obtain a new 2-DOF spatial 5R linkage.</p>

<p>The configuration of the 5R linkage was defined by the structure analysis and graphical simulations.Also considers the secrets of paradoxical mobility, the methods of design, manufacture and assembly.</p>

<p>For industrial application, this mechanism has been used to construct a controllable 3D mixer. The computer and experimental model was obtained and investigated (fig. 2).</p>
