			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>Peculiarities of changes in hormonal status of female white rats (Wistar) during pregnancy exposed to tobacco smokewere studied. Before pregnancy experimental group of animals was at a daily 30-minute exposure to tobacco smoke in the seed chamber 2 times a day within three weeks. Every rat in the experiment received a maximum of 0,048 mg of nicotine. After the end of each 30 minute session animals were removed from the seed chamber and maintained in sanitary conditions of the vivarium. It was determined that pre-pregnancy levels of FSH in the test group 55.6% less than the control. Content of LH and progesterone were not significantly different in the experimental and control groups. On the 20th day of pregnancy FSH levels in the experimental group was less by 68.9% than in control, LH levels was less by 65.5%. The study was supported by the Ministry of Orenburg regionin 2014 (the projectb # 36).</p>
