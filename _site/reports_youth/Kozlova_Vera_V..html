			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>The structure of human pressure on the environment varies development of production: prevailing mechanical influence gave way to chemical deformations that occur in the concentration and redistribution of natural chemicals, brings technogenesis products which have no natural analogs and natural destruktant. Especially sharply these questions arise in the industrial centers. Definition of level of anthropogenous loading in such territories, identification of the most dangerous pollutants of a surrounding medium and their localization, selection of pollution-free sites in the territory of the city, the most suitable for accommodation of the population is an important problem [1].</p>
<p>The main objective of researches consisted in that on the basis of the analysis of natural tablets to install the mechanism of migration and dynamics of the contents dust aerosols and some chemical elements in the environment under the influence of climatic factors and anthropogenous influence to establish their influence on population health.</p>
<p>Snow was used as object of research during the winter period, in the summer studying of dust pollution was carried out with using of tablets and leaves in 50 points of the city in 2013-2014. The common maintenance of suspended particles and some heavy metals was defined. The total pollution index was calculated to assess the contamination of snow metals. Maps of the distribution of pollution are based on the resulting figures.</p>
<p>Pollution-free districts of the city and areas with the raised technogenic loading were allocated with use of the glaciochemical analysis. Comparison of the results to literary data [1-4], allowed to conclude that the state of the environment in Tyumen gets worse every year, the maintenance of a dust in the air of the city increases. Chemical composition of dust losses in the city territory significantly differs on seasons, and both quantitatively, and is qualitative.</p>
