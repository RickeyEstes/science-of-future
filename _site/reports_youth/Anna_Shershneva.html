			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>Designing of controlled drug delivery systems is a promising and rapidly developing line of biotechnology and experimental pharmacology. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are promising materials for creation such systems. They are biocompatible and biodegradability in the body. Also, the dosage forms based on these polymers will improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the negative effects of drugs on the organism.<br><br>
The aims of this work were to prepare microparticles from different types of PHAs and to study the influence of the chemical composition and the process of preparation microparticles (emulsion method, spray dryer) on their surface characteristics (zeta potential, the average diameter) and to evaluate biocompatibility and efficacy of drug-loaded PHAs microparticles.<br><br>
Also possible toxicity of PHAs microparticles in experiments with mouse fibroblast cells was investigated. It was further investigated penetration of particle into cells were carried out with different sizes (micro-, submicro and nanoparticles).<br><br>
The different drug-loaded microparticles were developed and investigated. Efficacy of drug-loaded microparticles was studied in vitro and in vivo (on laboratory animals).<br><br>
The study was supported by the Government of the Russian Federation (Decree No. 220 of 09.04.2010) (Agreement No. 11.G34.31.0013)
