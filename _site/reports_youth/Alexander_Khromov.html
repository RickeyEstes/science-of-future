			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>The RED100 experiment aims to measure coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. This process was predicted by the Standard Model but has never been observed yet. The primary experimental challenge is a very small amount of energy deposited in a detector. We propose to use a two-phase emission detector with liquid xenon as a working medium. This technology can be applied in rare events search that was successfully proved by modern low background experiments looking for Dark Matter .The RED100 experimental setup consists of several systems that provide stable and effective operation. These systems are the detector itself located inside a shielding, cryogenics, purification, electronics and data acquisition. The detector principle of operation and design are described. All systems for the operation of the detector are covered with the main focus on cryogenics and purification. The cryogenics system is based on thermosyphon technology that guarantees stable performance of the detector in the temperature range of 170-185 К. The purification system is necessary for removing electronegative and molecular impurities that affect charge and light collection. The current status of the RED100 detector is discussed as well. In conclusion, future plans for deploying the RED100 detector at a candidate neutrino source are presented.</p>
