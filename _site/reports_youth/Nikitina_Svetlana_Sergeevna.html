			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>A physically active lifestyle is an important component of happiness. Active people are in general more happy, and the relation is known to be causal, that is, inducing a more active behavior promotes wellbeing – as well as better health.<br>
In this research we study and identify challenges and solutions in promoting physical activity among independently living older adults who cannot leave their home, for logistical or health reasons. The solution we develop and study is a tablet-based home fitness program meant to be usable by any older adult, no matter how technologically challenged or adverse, as long as they can see, hear, and stand up and walk by themselves. We also extend the study to other categories of people who have difficulties for various reasons in leaving their home to exercise, such as parents of young children.<br>
Specifically, this paper summarizes our earlier work and results on older adults and presents results from our study on young mothers, emphasizing similarities and differences between these two classes of people but showing that the same solution can be applied.
