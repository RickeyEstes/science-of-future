			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>The aim of this work was to develop and investigate a series of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) of different composition and to assess their suitability as cell scaffolds in the form of casting films, membranes formed by ultrathin fibers obtained by electrospinning, 3D compact matrices. The differences of mechanical and surface properties depending on the composition of the polymers was shown: with increasing of fraction of the additional component except for 3-hydroxybutyrate hydrophilicity and elasticity and mechanical strength increased. Elecrospinning membranes had differences in mechanical properties depending on the orientation of the fibers. Suitability of the PHA scaffolds as cell substrate was evaluated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts NIH 3T3. All of the studied types of PHA-scaffolds supported the adhesion and proliferation of cells.<br><br>
The study was supported by the Projects “Biotechnologies of novel biomaterials” (Agreement No. 11.G34.31.0013) in accordance with Resolution No 220 of Government of the Russian Federation of April, 9, 2010.
