			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>In the context of global environmental pollution and adverse ecological situation it is no doubt the need for stricter environmental analytical monitoring. Analytical procedure for determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which adopted in everyday practice of environmental monitoring services involve complex sampling comprising concentration on the sorbent, thermal desorption or solvent extraction. In addition the calibration is carried out without sample preparation steps. However, it is known that the implementation of a reliable quantification of VOC is necessary to carry out of procedures for the sample preparation and gas chromatography calibration under identical conditions.The calibration mixture must be subjected to the same preparation steps as the real sample. In this regard, the development of analytical tools and techniques for reliably determination of VOCs in the air by using of calibration mixtures conformanceв to real samples.<br>
The results of estimating the accuracy of the quantitative determination of VOCs in the air by the chromato-desorption macro- and microsystems and the comparison it with standardized techniques are represented in the research. It is shown that the measurement accuracy depends on the calibration method and the method of calibration mixtures preparation. Advantages of the chromato-desorption systems for the calibration gas mixtures preparation for determination of VOCs in ambient air, workplace air and industrial emissions are experimentally confirmed. It is shown that relative systematic error of suggested techniques is by 10 - 15% less than the one of the standard techniques.<br>
The study was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation under project № 608.</p>
