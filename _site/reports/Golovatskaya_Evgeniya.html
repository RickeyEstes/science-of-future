<p>The studying of biological productivity of plant communities is one of the important tasks in research of biogeochemical cycles of biosphere. The biological productivity is the ability of living organisms to create, preserve and transform organic matter. Value of productivity depends on species composition in ecosystem, climatic and hydrothermal conditions. Tree layer was studier for estimation of vegetative cover changing at bogs draining for purpose of forest melioration. Production of trees on oligotrophic bogs is small, and trees are holding no value for economic needs. Therefore the productivity of tree layer is weakly studied. However, from the viewpoint of an estimation of carbon balance in peatlands, research of production and storage of biomass of tree layers is an actual problem.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to estimate storages of biomass and biological productivity for tree layers and soil cover of oligotrophic peatlands in the southern taiga of Western Siberia.</p>
<p>The present study is devoted to investigation of net primary production at oligotrophic bog under anthropogenic impact. The studied peatland is titled «Kirsanovskoe» and it located in the northern part of Ob’ and Tom’ interfluve (56°21`N 82°31`E). Kirsanovskoe bog includes pine– shrub–sphagnum community (PSS) and sedge-sphagnum fen (SF).</p>
