			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>A team of 35 researchers (including students and graduate students) from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Space Research Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences was awarded by a grant of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science and Education to study atmospheres of planets in the Solar System. Our research is being made in the following basic directions: 1) Analysis and interpretation of observational data from the Mars Express and Venus Express orbiters developed by the European Space Agency; 2) Ground-based spatially-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy of the atmospheres of Mars and Venus; 3) Three-dimensional circulation models for the atmospheres of Mars, Venus, and Titan and photochemical models for these atmospheres; 4) Preparation of new planetary missions and basic ideas, design, and manufacturing of new instruments for planetary research. 1a. We have an infrared spectrometer that was made by our team and is currently operating at the Mars Express orbiter. The spectrometer covers a range of 1.0-1.7 μm with resolving power of 1500. The instrument is measuring abundances, vertical profiles, and their seasonal, latitudinal, and diurnal variations for water vapor, CO, dust, haze, and O2 dayglow and polar nightglow at 1.27 μm. Analysis and interpretation of the data have been made and are in progress. 1b. An improved version of our infrared spectrometer is currently in operation onboard the Venus Express orbiter. The instrument covers a range of 0.65 to 1.7 μm with resolving power of 1500. The observations revealed abundances and variations of water vapor in the deep atmosphere near 15 km and near the cloud tops at ~70 km. The O2 nightglow emission at 1.27 μm is observed at various conditions, and the observations revealed a very specific combination of the subsolar-antisolar and zonal circulations near the Venus mesopause. 1c. Some of our team members are co-investigators in other instrument teams at Venus Express. Of great value is the study of long-term variations of the atmospheric circulation near the cloud tops at ~70 km that is based on images of Venus from the orbiter. Another study with a crucial contribution from our researches is the variations of the main sulfur species from 70 to 110 km. 2. Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy of the atmospheres of Mars and Venus is made using the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on Hawaii, Mauna Kea, elevation 4.2 km. The telescope diameter is 3 m, and a spectrograph CSHELL covers a range of 1.08 to 5.6 μm with resolving power of 40000. The high elevation with low overhead water and excellent astroclimate are favorable for spectroscopy of planetary atmospheres. First detections of DCl, DF, and variations of D/H in water near the Venus cloud tops are the results that are essential for evolution of water on Venus and overall evolution of the Venus atmosphere. Detections of the CO dayglow at 4.7 μm in the atmospheres of Mars and Venus make it possible to observe variations of CO and temperature near 50 km on Mars and near 105 km on Venus. Observations of the O2 airglow at 1.27 μm were continued on both planets as well. 3. Three-dimensional modeling of dynamics for the atmospheres of Mars, Venus, and Titan is a very sophisticated problem. Some improvements have been found; overall, the work is in progress. Photochemical modeling was especially fruitful for the atmospheres of Venus and Titan. A model for the most active middle atmosphere of Venus was significantly updated. We also improved our model for the nighttime atmosphere and night airglow on Venus that is essential to explain the nightglow of NO, O2, and OH observed by Venus Express. Chemical kinetic model for the lower atmosphere of Venus has been made as well. A new version of photochemical model for Titan’s atmosphere and ionosphere was created and compared with the observations from the Cassini orbiter. 4a. A heterodyne spectrometer for the middle infrared region is under development by our team. This type of spectrometer provides very high resolving power ~10,000,000. The existing heterodyne spectrometers start at 8 μm, while our instrument is designed to start at 3 μm. There are some problems in science and technology to complete this work that is in progress. A light version of this instrument is considered to be installed at a Mars landing platform that is planned for 2018 by a cooperation of ESA and RosKosmos. The expected sensitivity for methane is better than that at the Curiosity rover. Some other gases will be measured as well. 4b. Currently the Mars Trace Gas Orbiter is under development by ESA and RosKosmos. Our team is responsible for a suite of instruments for chemical composition of the atmosphere and climate (Atmospheric Chemistry Suite, ACS). It includes three high-resolution spectrometers that cover a range from 0.7 to 17 μm. (This work is mostly funded by RosKosmos.)
