			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>The project aims at enhancing the research and education at NSU in energy engineering through advanced theoretical, numerical and experimental studies of physical processes  relevant to energy conversion, utilization and the environmental impact. The program involves the simultaneous  computational simulations (DNS, LES, advanced RANS and Hybrid methods) and in-depth experimental research (based on laser diagnostics) of turbulent single- and multi-phase flows, transport phenomena and combustion. The project should generate new knowledge, new research results, know-how and tools, to be used to  optimize and innovate design, improve efficiency and develop new concepts, processes and equipment. The specific topics investigated are: </p>
<p>-	Unsteady phenomena in hydropower engineering with focus on cavitation, related multi-phase phenomena and material erosion,  vortical structures – vortex precessing and spiraling rope - in hydro-turbine draft tubes; </p>
<p>-	Combustion of gas- and solid fuels with focus on stabilization of low-emission lean flames by swirl and pulsation, extinction of diffusion flames over vaporizing liquids and solids, and combustion of mechanically-activated micronized coal; </p>
<p>-	Dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere and water environment over complex terrain with heat islands, point and field pollution sources, under specific (and  extreme) stratification conditions.  </p>
<p>-	Evaporation, combustion and self-conservation of methane gas hydrates (the promising fuel of the XXI century</p>
<p>The common denominators of all processes are: complex flows, turbulence, heat and mass transfer at extreme conditions, combustion and other chemical reactions, and other transport phenomena, all in real configurations and scales.  </p>
<p>The synergy of the complementing experiments and computer simulations have made it possible to get a deeper insight into various phenomena and processes which are inaccessible or difficult to achieve if only experimental or computational method had been used. Some highlights and major achievements will be presented.</p>
<p>The work was supported by the Government of the Russian Federation (№ 11.G34.31.0046)</p>
