			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>Our research program intends to explore the complexity and the variety of  Russian elites’ attitudes and reactions towards European norms, innovations and models form the 18th century to the fall of the Tsarist Empire in February 1917.  Relying on a vast documentary and archivist corpus that we are currently elaborating together, it analyzes the different types of Russian reactions in front of European influence, studies the process of diffusion of European science, techniques, culture and  of way of life, identifies the  agents that favored this diffusion, but also those of the Russians that rejected this European influence by fear of losing their own identity.  Our collective research deals not only with concrete matters (for example, the adoption and diffusion of scientific knowledge and techniques) but also with mental perceptions and representations in order to get the exact measure of the relationship that took place between Russian elites and Europe. At the end, this research should bring a new light on the nature  of these relations and their meaning not only for Russian identity but for Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>In the time given, my contribution will present the general theme of our research program, will mention some of the sources the research is based on,  and will deliver some preliminary elements of conclusion.  </p>
