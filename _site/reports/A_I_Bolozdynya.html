			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>A new instrumentation for fundamental research in field of Elementary Particle Physics is under development now at the Laboratory for Experimental Nuclear Physics (LENP) established at NRNU MEPhI under leadership of Prof. Yuri Efremenko. Results of the R&D shall be used for development of advanced technology for nuclear installation monitoring and non-proliferation. The project is being performed in close collaboration with scientists from NRC Kurchatov Institute and the Oak Ridge U.S. National Laboratory having significant experience in registration of neutrino radiation from nuclear reactors. We look forward to active cooperation in this area with the State Corporation ROSATOM and have established collaboration with the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research with purpose to arrange an experimental neutrino detection facility at the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant. The process of neutrino elastic interaction with a massive nucleus via coherent scattering has a large cross sectionthat is proportional to the square to the neutron number N2 in target nuclei. This is valid for neutrino energies up to about 50 MeV, and thus can be applied to reactor, solar and supernova neutrinos. The magnification factor N2 gives a significant increase in cross section for detectors using heavy nuclei as target. This fact can pave a way for compact neutrino detectors which could have a great impact on nuclear reactor monitoring technologies. This reaction has never been observed experimentally because of the very low energy of recoil nucleus. The RED100 detector using 200 kg liquid Xenon as a working medium is under construction now at the LENP. All subsystems of the experimental setup, including the detector itself, cryogenic system, data acquisition, and shielding need have to be integrated into a single system, a sufficiently reliable for the experiment duration of about 1 year. In parallel with the establishment of such a facility we are working on tuning the computer model of the experiment, including last data on the ionization yield of nuclear recoils, acquired data on actual background conditions of the experiment in order to optimize functioning of the experimental setup. We consider perspectives to discover a neutrino coherent scattering effect at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and continue the detail research of neutrino-nuclei interactions at the Kalinin NPP.</p>
