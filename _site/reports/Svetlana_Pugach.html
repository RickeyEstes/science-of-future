			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>The Great Siberian Rivers integrate meteorological and hydrological changes in their watersheds and play a significant role in the physical and biogeochemical regime of the Arctic Ocean through transport of fresh water (FW) and carbon into the sea. The East Siberian Arctic shelf which represents the widest and shallowest continental shelf in the World Ocean, yet it is still poorly explored. This region is characterized by the highest rate of coastal erosion and significant volume of the riverine discharge and exhibits the largest gradients in all oceanographic parameters observed for the entire Arctic Ocean. Here we demonstrate a connection among Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) which represents the colored fraction of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), salinity and pCO2. Our data have documented strong linear correlations between salinity and CDOM in the near shore zone strongly influenced by riverine runoff. Combined analysis of CDOM and DOC data demonstrated a high degree of correlation between these parameters. Such close connection between these characteristics of waters in this region makes it possible to restore the distribution of DOC according to our original CDOM data of the profiling systems. It is shown that the CDOM can be used as a conservative tracer to follow the transport and fate of FW across the Arctic shelf through a combination of remote sensing and field observations.
