			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>The project 11.G34.31.0066 is going on from 2011. The breadth of subject-matter is a characteristic property of this project. Its title is “Interdisciplinary study at the turn of physics (radio-physics, acoustics, laser physics, micro waves), unique medical instrument-making and diagnostic methods for material and Earth sciences”.</p>
<p>The key word “radio-physics” should be explained. That is the term widely used in Russia, along with another term “theoretical physics”. It appeared in the beginning of 20th Century after outstanding achievements in radio communication, radio-location, signal processing, and radio instruments design. However, the classical radio-physics impacted on all natural, technological sciences, and even on the humanities. That is why this term in the broad sense of the word is used to mark interdisciplinary studies using methods and ideas of physics of vibrations and waves. [А.V.Gaponov-Grekhov and М.А.Мiller. Encyclopedia of Physics. V.4. Моscow, Big Russian Encyclopedia, 1994].</p>
<p>Radio-physics in the broad sense is equivalent to the sum of sciences marked outside Russia as: “Theory of Vibrations and Waves”, “Electrical Engineering”, “Acoustics”, “Mechanical Engineering”, “Nonlinear Dynamics”, “Laser physics and Quantum Electronics”, “Signal processing”, and “Microwaves”.</p>
<p>Radio-physical scientific school of Nizhni Novgorod always was accepted as one of world-leading. The first Radio-physical Faculty appeared at Nizhni Novgorod State University (NNSU). Outstanding scientists were among its founders: academician A.A.Andronov (father of modern “Nonlinear Thinking”);Professor M.T.Grekhova (first Dean of the Radio Physical Faculty); and academician V.L.Ginzburg (Nobel Prize winner, first Head of the Department of radio wave propagation).</p>
<p>Wide experience in this area has also academician O.V.Rudenko, the leading scientist of this project. Many years he was Head of radio-physics division of Moscow University. He is awarded by State prizes of USSR and Russia. He is the author of about 400 papers and 20 books published in Russian, English and Chinese.</p>
<p>Head of MedLab at NNSU is professor S.N.Gurbatov, State prize of Russia award. Many years he was the Dean of Radio-physics faculty. Now he is Vice-rector of NNSU responsible for scientific studies. O.V.Rudenko and S.N.Gurbatov collaborate during 40 years being heads of both acoustics departments existing in classical Russian universities.</p>
<p>The Project was aimedat the creation of the Lab, able to be an important international center of the competence in applied physics. ThatMedLabalreadyexists. StudiesinMedLabarecarryingoutbyco-workersofdepartmentsandfacultiesofNNSU. Followinglinesofinvestigationaremostimportant:</p>
<p>1. Acousticdiagnosticsandhigh-intensityultrasound</p>
<p>2. Laserandmicrowavemedicaldevices</p>
<p>MedLabcollaborates with the Faculty of Physics of Moscow University, with Institutes of Russian academy of sciences: Institute of applied physics, Institute of physics of microstructures, General physics institute, Earth physics institute; with foreign universities and private companies, and with the Volga district medical center.</p>
<p>MedLab and created after the project Small innovation business companies will be included in the Growth Zone of medical instrument-making and high technologies on NNSU. That is one of 5 university centers organized by Federal Special Program “Development of pharmaceutical and medical industry of Russia for the period to 2020” (financing is 1.5 billion rubles, area of Growth Zone building is 25000 sq. meters).</p>
<p>1.	Mathematics.New nonlinear integro-differential equations (IDE) are suggested, their exact solutions are found. Group analysis is performed (jointly with the Mega-grant team from Ufa aviation Institute, and 3 papers are published). For confluent kernels known Burgers, KdV, Rudenko-Robsman, Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili models may be derived from IDE. Results are applied to high-intensity waves in biological tissues, blood vessels, to geophysics and to the friction welding.</p>
<p>2.	Mаthematical physics and nonlinear wave dynamics. The classification is suggested of 3 types of strongly nonlinear waves and strongly expressed weak nonlinearity. Exactly solvable models are discovered: Heisenberg-type equation for continuous systems and cubic Burgers equation. New phenomena are studied (instability of compression shocks, stability of rarefaction shocks, corpuscular properties of singular solutions, etc.). Models of quadratically cubic nonlinear systems are suggested. Models of nonlinear acoustics are extended to the formation of cell structure of the Universe and clots of dark matter.</p>
<p>3.	Computermаthematic.Studies performed on computer graphics,data bank formation, processing of ultrasonic, optical and MRI images.</p>
<p>4.	Fundamentalandappliedphysics. Theoretical and experimental works are performed on nonlinear acoustics, waves in biological media, microwave THz spectroscopy, mechanics, hemodynamics, remote thermometry, dynamics of hereditary media, laser acoustics, physics of huge nonlinearities, new diagnostic methods, and wave geophysics.</p>
<p>5.	Creation of laboratory model devices, educational set-up and practical works. Opticalmicro-elastographtissues. 5.8. Individual c.</p>
<p>6.	Commercialization</p>
<p>7.	Intellectual property. 5 patents were taken out or corresponding positive decisions are taken.</p>
<p>8.	Teaching. 13 lecture courses were created and delivered after MedLab achievements. In particular: Acoustical studies in biology and medicine; Methods of spectroscopy in medicine and biology; Interaction of electromagnetic waves with biological systems and living beings; Ultrasonic echo-semiotics of resected parenchymatous degenerations; Ultrasound in medicine. The program of post-graduate education is developed jointly with General physics institute for specialty 01.04.06 (acoustics).</p>
<p>9.	Publication activity. 90 papers are published in indexing journals. Monography is published by Springer; its Russian version was awarded by Main prize of MAIK/Nauka in 2012. One Dr.Sci. and 4 PhD theses were defended.</p>
