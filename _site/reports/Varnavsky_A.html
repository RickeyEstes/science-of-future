			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>Rational mode of work and rest - this ratio and the content of work and rest periods in which high productivity combined with high and sustainable human performance without signs of excessive fatigue for a long time. Introduction rational regime of work and rest contributes to high performance and productivity, preservation of enterprise employee health and their development in a professional and personal level.<br>
The purpose of work is to develop a method for determining the optimum parameters of work and rest regime of enterprise employee based on the use of a genetic algorithm.
A model of the dynamics of employee working capacity at intense activity, taking into account the individual properties and the current functional status is developed. Based on the model, a model depending of labor productivity from the parameters of work and rest is built.<br>
Genetic algorithm was used to determine the optimal duration of work and rest intervals that maximizes productivity. To do this, method encoding parameters of employee individual properties in the "chromosomes" is set, initial population including the duration of work and rest intervals is created. Next, fitness function of each individual corresponding to maximize productivity is calculated, "crossing" of the fittest, the birth of new individuals and mutation is carried out. These actions are repeated a predetermined number of times, resulting in the best individuals corresponding to the optimal duration of work and rest intervals were selected.</p>
