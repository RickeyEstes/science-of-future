			<p>The analysis of the sociocultural systems based on archeological materials is associated with the problems of the source’s information value and its correctness. This problem can be overcome if one uses a complex of sources. The most important is the archeological and the ethnographical data. Its use is possible in the archeological complexes of the XVII – first half of the XX century. For us, especially interesting are the settlements of the ancestors of the Siberian Tatars, which existed in the XVII century. On the one hand, there are written sources on them, on the other hand, they contain the materials which are less destroyed and distorted by the time, which allows for a more complete understanding on the everyday life of the people of that time. Analyzing this data and comparing it with the later materials, in some cases obtained from the same complexes, one can imagine the dynamics of the sociocultural systems. Relying on familiar historic events one can trace their influence on the everyday life of the population and study the peculiarities and the mechanisms of the transformation of the sociocultural systems.</p>
