			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>I will review a series of experiments performed within recently established collaboration between German and Russian laboratories jointly working on various aspects of superconducting and quantum metamaterials. This fascinating research field opened up only few years ago and is presently rapidly developing. The focus of our experimental studies is on ultra-low loss electromagnetic metamaterials comprised of networks of superconducting elements. The design flexibility of superconducting thin-film networks and circuits allows for utilizing small structures down to the nanoscale while maintaining low loss properties, very strong and well-controlled nonlinearity, and frequency tunability. This approach opens up an opportunity to develop novel superconducting devices with non-trivially tailored and employed electromagnetic properties, which can be functionalized as ultra-compact antenna arrays, phase modulators, integrated tunable isolators, active emitter arrays, novel bolometers, etc. Expanding towards these novel applications in space research, communication and sensing technology will become one of the priorities for this research field in the nearest future. Superconducting quantum metamaterials comprised of arrays of superconducting qubits are emerging new field for fundamental studies in quantum optics, opening a possibility to explore collective quantum dynamics under very strong coupling between electromagnetic field and artificial atoms.</p>
