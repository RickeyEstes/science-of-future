			<p>Immunotherapy holds promise as a potential approach to cancer treatment. In cell-based therapies autologous T-lymphocytes are isolated and manipulated in vitro prior transfer back to the patient. In particular, harvested T-cells undergo gene-engineered modification for expression of target proteins. Such engineered T-lymphocytes could mediate dramatic, potent, and durable clinical response. The main difficulty is to obtain stable and effective expression of target proteins in T-lymphocytes. Use of the Cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) for stable transgene expression in T-cells is inefficient. Inefficient transcription from CMV is due to silencing of this promoter in cells of hematopoietic origin. Thereby, investigation of optimal promoter for T-cells protein expression was the main goal of current study. Here we performed the comparison of commonly used constitutive promoters: CMV (Cytomegalovirus promoter), EF1A (Human elongation factor-1 alpha promoter), CD2 (T-cell surface antigen Cluster of Differentiation 2 promoter) and NP (р53 promoter-leader region). For detection of expression protein levels we used tagRFP (derived from Entacmaea quadricolor) expression cassettes which we delivered by recombinant lentivirus particles. Stable cell lines we analyzed in vitro by FACS. We found that these promoters vary considerably in their strength. These results should facilitate more rational choices of promoters for gene expression in T-cells.   </p>
