			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>Development of the chemical and petrochemical industry is impossible without the creation of new production technologies of raw materials and products. To a large degree, the success in this field is defined broadly using catalysts, particularly copper containing catalysts. Typically to create catalysts used as the carrier an oxide ceramic or a porous substrate. In our opinion, promising all-metal nanocatalysts can be made of copper and its oxides with high surface area. Such catalysts have many advantages, but one major drawback - low specific surface area.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a number of ways to increase the specific surface area of copper-containing catalysts and supports for them. In particular, to increase the specific surface of the carrier it is possible by heat treatment in oxygen-containing environment, and increase the surface area can nanocatalyst by growing by electrodeposition on the carrier:</p>
<p>- layers of copper nanoparticles;</p>
<p>- icosahedral small particles (ISP) of copper and subsequent by etching;</p>
<p>- ISP copper and subsequent heat treatment in a vacuum;</p>
<p>- pentagonal copper crystals and their subsequent heat treatment in oxygen-containing medium;</p>
<p>- crystals, the copper layers and coatings having been in the initial state after the electrodeposition developed surface.</p>
