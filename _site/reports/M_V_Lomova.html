			TALKING POINTS:<br>
			<p>Polymeric layer-by-layer encapsulation is one of perspective methods for incorporation and delivery of drugs. Layer-by-layer approach for shells formation around solid or liquid cores with or without their subsequent extraction is resulting in microspheres with unique properties that are studied by many scientific groups during last 2 decades. Possibility of remote controlled release by light, ultrasound, chemical and physical treatments; capsules navigation in presence of applied magnetic field; encapsulation of wide range of hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances make microcapsules a quite interesting scientific area for a vast variety of applications.</p>
<p>Enzymatic degradation of microcontainers can be utilized as a release method, while enzyme specificity may provide selectivity. A variety of studies report investigations of model substances release from microcapsules upon enzyme treatment.</p>
<p>We suggest replacement of traditional pair of biocompatible polyelectrolytes poly-L-arginine hydrochloride and dextran sulfate sodium salt with amphiphilic bovine serum albumine and polyphenol tannic acid for preparation of microcapsules on the solid (calcium carbonate microparticles) and liquid (sunflower oil droplets) cores for drugs encapsulation. Low cytotoxity of protein\phenol hollow capsules for murine RAW264.7 macrophages cell was shown by MTT cell viability analysis. Enzymatic degradation of capsules was studied by confocal and scanning electron microscopy. Microcapsules shells constructed of tannic acid and bovine serum albumin are degraded by chymotrypsin treatment already after 10 hours of incubation, as well as are microcapsules with shells assembled from poly-L-arginine and dextran sulfate sodium salt. After 10 hours of trypsin treatment poly-L-arginine\dextran sulfate sodium salt microcapsules are totally destroyed, while tannic acid\bovine serum albumin microcapsules only loose their shells integrity.</p>
<p>Microcapsules with protein/phenol shells can be used for oral delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances. Specific properties of the tannic acid can protect encapsulated substances from oxidation can be obtained. Potentially, utilization of proteins obtained from the person for drugs encapsulation can be used for customized personal high effective therapy.</p>
