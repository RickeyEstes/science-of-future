<p>There were investigated the peculiarities of the formation of coastal marine shore complexes of deposits as a result of erosion and sedimentation processes in the shelf zone of Sakhalin island by remote sensing data and information about the composition of solid particles in the turbidity current. Experimental studies were carried out in the area of Okhotsk village, in the Mordvinova Gulf of the Sea of Okhotsk. There were determined the peculiarities of sedimentation in the coastal area, characteristic of the Eastern coast of Sakhalin island, with total length of 2 km and distance from the shore 1 km. Information about the chemical and granulometric structure of the transported material, selected by using of the supervisory bottom stations were processed with the use of nanotechnologies, migration pathways were fixed by GIS-technologies. The main regularities of the formation of deposits were identified for shelf of Sakhalin island.</p>
