№ 33.1684.2014/К<br>
The idea of the Ethnographo-Archeological Complex (EAC) was first proposed in 1981 by N.A. Tomilov and V. B. Bogomolov.<br>
Significant lacunas have been found out in the theoretical base of the EAK conception on the level of the method of historical reconstructions. The possibilities for creating such methods were only vaguely marked.<br>
One of the first attempts of practical and theoretical research on the EAC problem was the work of V.V. Dryagin, V.B. Melnikov, V.B. Yashin in the end of 1980-es. Among the finding of this team, the most significant is the concept of the basic memorial.<br>
Next to deal with the problem was the author of the conception, N.A. Tomilov, in his 1991 project “Ethnographo-Archeological Complexes of the Peoples of the Western Siberia”.<br>
In the frames of this project there were elaborated “integrative” methods of data collecting, historiography and the history of integration of archeology and ethnography, the elaboration of the conceptual construct was started, as well as the source study research. These studies were considered worthwhile and are being carried on presently.
