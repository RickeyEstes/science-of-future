			<p>Fluorescent pH and temperature sensors based on hybrid nanoparticles</p>
<p>Submicron fluorescent polymer particles attract considerable attention in medical and biotechnological applications as valuable tools for diagnosis, imaging, and optical tracking. Luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs) are a very promising alternative to organic dyes due to their excellent photostability, high quantum yield, and a narrow emission peak which depends only on the QD size (about 2–8 nm), irrespective of the excitation wavelength [1-3]. In the past decades increasing attention has been paid to the preparation of “smart” functionalized polymer particles reversibly responding to slight environmental changes, such as variations of temperature, pH, and ionic strength [4, 5]. We designed composite polymer particles with pH- and thermosensitive fluorescence consisting of a solid polymer core and a stimulus-sensitive shell doped with CdSe/ZnS QDs.</p>
<p>Composite polymer particles with pH-sensitive fluorescence were prepared by the layer-by-layer deposition technique [5]. Polyacrolein (PA) particles were used as cores for deposition of hydrophilic QD/polyelectrolyte multilayers formed by electrostatic interactions. A PA core was used because PA particles with variable diameters and narrow size distribution are easy to prepare and contain surface aldehyde groups, which facilitate the formation of strong bonds with the first polyelectrolyte (PE) layer [6]. We used poly-L-lysine (PLL) for the first layer and Na–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) for the next one due to its negative charge. Thus, two-layer PE films (PLL/PSS) were formed. These layers formed a smooth, uniform, positively charged outer surface facilitating further adsorption of QDs. QDs were synthesized in organic solvents and were solubilizied using the ligand exchange technique in the presence of hexamethylenediamine or tetramethylammonium hydroxide follo! wed by PSS stabilization. Thus, PSS served as both a stabilizer and a component of the deposited layers.</p>
<p>The pH-sensitive fluorescence of QDs and pH-dependent conformation of polyelectrolytes passivating the nanocrystal surface state allowed us to obtain both mono- and multiplex coded polymer particles with pH-dependent fluorescence intensity. The outermost layer is essential for the use of fluorescent polymer particles in bioassay. For example, the fluorescence of these polymer particles with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the outer layer is sensitive to copper (II) ions, while the fluorescence of these particles is practically insensitive to other divalent cations (Zn2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Co2+, and Mg2+) [7,8]. The detection limit of Cu2+ is about 15 nM.</p>
<p>Such a specific quenching of fluorescence by copper ions may be explained by the different affinities and coordination numbers between BSA and divalent ions despite their identical charges. These differences gave rise to changes in the BSA folding pattern, and, hence, in the molecule flexibility. Therefore, the BSA–Cu2+ complex was, apparently, more rigid than complexes with the other ions, and its formation destroyed the passivating coating of QDs. As a result, strong fluorescence quenching was observed. Moreover, copper (II) induced the formation of stronger BSA–PSS complex than those formed in the absence of copper (II). This caused an increase in the rigidity of the deposited layers, which led to deformation of the passivating shell of QDs, thereby enhancing the quenching of the QD fluorescence. Thus, the fluorescent polymer particles containing QDs and BSA in outer polyelectrolyte layers can be used for sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+.</p>
<p>Polymer particles consisting of a solid poly(acrolein-co-styrene) core and a poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) polymer shell doped with QDs were fabricated by radical seed polymerization of N-vinylcaprolactam. The temperature response of the composite particles was observed as a decrease in their hydrodynamic diameter upon heating above the lower critical solution temperature of the thermosensitive PVCL polymer. Embedding QDs in the PVCL shell yielded particles whose fluorescence was sensitive to temperature changes. This sensitivity was determined by the dependence of the QD fluorescence intensity on the distances between them in the PVCL shell. The QD-containing thermosensitive particles were bound with protein molecules in such a way that they retained their thermosensitive properties, including the completely reversible temperature dependence of their fluorescence response.</p>
<p>Bioanalytical applications of the thermosensitive particles developed were illustrated by two examples of their use for real-time remote monitoring of the local temperature of a reaction mixture in the course of exothermic chemical reactions, enzymatic hydrolysis of BSA and cross-linking of chitosan. Thus, these particles may be used for sensing and encoding, as well as in immunochemical and other bioassays.</p>
