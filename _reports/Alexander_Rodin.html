<p>Planetary atmospheres are in the state of constant motion, with scales ranging from general circulation to mesoscale waves, turbulence and dissipative processes. The dynamics influences thermal regime and radiation balance of planetary atmospheres, determine advection regime and mixing of chemical species, clouds and aerosols. The most  powerful method of theorectical studies of atmospheric dynamics are 3D general circulation models (GCM). Our group has developed GCMs of the atmospheres of Venus and Titan, based on the full set of gas dynamics equations which reveals an unprecedented numerical efficiency. This model for the first time allowed onte to reproduce simultaneously two basic regimes of Venus atmospheric circulation - zonal superrotation and subsolar-antisolar circulation. Another major result is simulation of polar vortices in the atmospheres of Venus and Titan.</p>
<p>Observational methods of planetary atmospheres monitoring still have limited capabilities, not allowing for the moment spacecraft implementation. MIPT's HRISPA lab has developed a lightweight heterodyne infrared spectrometer IVOLGA, capable of catching wind velocity based on Doppler shift of spectral lines. Development of imaging heterodyne IR spectrometers we envision in the near future opens a perspective to change our undestanding of the atmospheric circulation on Solar System planets.</p>
