<p>The research scientific work is aimed to develop and introduce the complex of the theoretically substantiated and conceptually correlated technical solutions providing power supply in the city’s fuel and power system. The tasks of efficiency enhancing by means of the improvement of the fuel combustion in the thermal power plants (thermal power stations and district power stations) and extension of the boiler thermal rating range were set. The issues of the enhancing treatment and delivery of the thermal power and water as well as provision of the reliable and continuous thermal power and water supply of the population were considered. As a result of the research scientific work, new awareness of the ways and methods of energy losses reduction at the heat power plants of the city has been obtained. Theoretical models for the effective use of the variable speed drives at the units producing heat and electric power at the central heat supply units and directly in the buildings as finite objects of the heat and water supply have been extended. </p>
