<p>Presentation will cover state of the art of development and application of luminescent quantum dots in analytical chemistry and clinical diagnostic. Semiconductor quantum dots are light-emitting particles on the nanometer scale that have emerged as a new class of fluorescent labels for chemical analysis, molecular imaging, and biomedical diagnostics. Small size, bright luminescence, photostability and turnable spectral characteristics are well suited for dynamic imaging at the single-molecule level and for multiplexed biomedical diagnostics at ultrahigh sensitivity. Properties of quantum dots, their synthesis and modification, variants of quantum dot based labels, conditions of signal generation together with advantages and disadvantages will be discussed.<br><br>
