<p>Based on the data from 1978 to 2013, we show that cultural diversity affects bilateral trade volumes. Cultural diversity is measured by the number of ethnic, religious and language groups and the size of the largest and second largest ethnic group. We suggest that this effect could be due to ethnic minority networks. The effect is stronger for reference priced and differentiated goods.</p>
