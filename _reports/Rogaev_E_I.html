<p>Identification of genes responsible for brain functions and pathologies is nowadays one of the most extensive fields of research in modern neurobiology. The Project is focused on study of new genetic factors and regulatory networks that control a number of complex neurobiological functions, such as neurophysiological adaptation of organisms through thermoregulation, thermal reception and feeding behavior/metabolism; CNS functions, including memory formation in norm and pathology, aging and neurodegeneration, behavior control of emotions and social behavior. For data generation and analysis of complex neurobiological traits we used integrated approach using unique biological material, latest technologies, e.g.  Next Generation of Sequencing along with comprehensive bioinformatics software package and databases.  The successful realization of the project goals is important for identifications of biological markers of brain functioning in norm and during the processes leading to neurodegeneration and malignancy. It will also lead to developing a new-generation of drugs capable of modulating human psychophysiological processes by acting precisely on target genes.</p>
