<p>Over the past few years, emerging new analysis capabilities from passive and active microwave observations of the ocean from space have already been demonstrated. At the same time ambitious investigations can further dwell on the first demonstrations to test how much an advanced radio-physical approach will help unveil more precisely the dynamics of the ocean-atmosphere couplings. Routinely available satellite observations offer new means to analyze and best exploit the differing electromagnetic wavelength and polarization sensitivity. This diversity opens new strategies, not restricted to one particular observing system, to develop, evolve, implement and validate more elaborated and dedicated Geophysical Model Function to retrieve key ocean surface information. These developments shall build on the existing archived measurements, but will essentially address sensors on-board new operating and near-future planning satellite platforms such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on satellites Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2, passive microwave radiometers AMSR2 and SSMIS on satellites GCOM-W1 and DMSP, microwave radiometer on SMOS, microwave passive/active on TRMM, AQUARIUS and future SMAP, scatterometer ASCAT on satellites Metop-A, B, the planned CNES SWIM Ku-band rotating real aperture instrument (SWIM), and the NASA Dual Frequency (Ku-band, Ka-band) Scatterometer (DFS/ERM) mission, which might further contribute to a new era in monitoring of global ocean surface wind, waves, and currents.</p>
