<p>Studying the identity issues occupies one of the leading positions in Russian and world humanitaristics. The interest of Russian researchers in the issues of identity studies has risen in the turn of XX-XXI centuries which was conditioned by rapidly changing social realities of Russia and the structural transformations of society which influence formation of new identities and transformation of the existing ones.<br><br>
The approaches to understanding the essence of ‘corporate identity’ phenomenon are different. Within the frames of the first approach, corporate identity is considered as a part of professional identity. The issues of corporate and professional identities from the point of personality socialization and personality’s professional growth are examined in the works of R.B. Berns, V.A. Yadov, E.R. Ahmetshina, O.L. Leybovich.
