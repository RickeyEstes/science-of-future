<p>The scintillator tiles with direct readout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) have been studied. The SiPM is placed inside the dimple machined in the center of the big face of $30\times30\times3\ \rm mm^3$ tile. The different dimple geometries were studied. The tiles with the optimal dimple design show the uniformity of response comparable to the tiles with fiber readout. The direct-readout approach provides a reasonable way for the construction of supermultichannel calorimeters.</p>
