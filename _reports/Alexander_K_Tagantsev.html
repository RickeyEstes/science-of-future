<p>Ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domains are well-known and widely-used as elements of information storage microelectronic devices. The recent developments in the physics of non-magnetic ferroics suggest that ferroic walls, in view of their nanometer thickness, may be conceived as elements for nanoelectronics. The present talk reports on antiphase domain boundaries in antiferroelectrics and charged domain walls in proper ferroelectrics as candidates for such elements. Based on theoretical results, it has been demonstrated experimentally that antiphase boundaries in antiferroelectric lead zirconate can carry spontaneous polarization, thus capable of serving as 2-nanometer thick information storage elements. It has been also documented that strongly charged domain walls in barium titanate can carry electronic gas, exhibiting a 9-order-of-magnitude enhancement of conductivity. Such walls might serve as movable 10-nanometer-thick conductive connectors.</p>
