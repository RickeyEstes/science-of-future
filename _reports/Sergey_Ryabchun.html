<p>In the past several decades superconductors have established themselves as the material of choice for detectors of electromagnetic radiation in the range that stretches from the visible to the far-infrared. Why is this range interesting? How do these detectors work? What lies in the future? These questions, among others, will be addressed in the talk.</p>
