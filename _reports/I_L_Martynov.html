<p>Luminophore optical properties modulation using different photonic structures attracts considerable attention at the present time. Such structures have great prospects for application in the field of optical sensors and lasing.</p>
<p>One of the most promising materials for fabrication of one-dimensional photonic structures (microcavities (MC) in particular) is porous silicon (Si-por). Large surface area and possibility of precise control over its optical properties are distinctive features of Si-por.</p>
<p>This study has demonstrated the ability to control organic semiconductor MEH-PPV and quantum dot CdSe/ZnS photoluminescence spectra using Si-pormicrocavity. Si-pormicrocavities have been fabricated by electrochemical etching and have single eigenmode at the wavelength varying from 550 to 640 nm with full width at half maximum (FWHM) value below 10 nm.</p>
<p>A drastic narrowing of the organic polymer and quantum dot photoluminescence spectra has been observed after its injection in Si-pormicrocavities, so that the FWHM of luminophore luminescence spectrum has become correlated with microcavityeigenmode FWHM. Also this work has demonstrated strong influence of the Si-pormicrocavity morphology on the penetration of organic polymer and quantum dot into the pores.</p>
