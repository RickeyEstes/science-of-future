<p>Some autonomous dissipative systems of ordinary differential equations used for the forming secure communication systems on their basis are considered. The preliminary analysis of their bifurcation behavior corresponds to the modern ideas if dynamical chaos theory (Feigenbaum-Sharkovskii-Magnitskii’s theory, FSM). The regularities of bifurcation cascades in the considered autonomous dissipative systems of ordinary differential equations are used for the forming secure communication systems on their basis. These regularities are in the properties of the obtaining of the lot attractors (multiattractor systems) and «contrast structures» out of the basis of FSM theory.</p>
<p>The multiattractor system allows to design the secure communications by method of modulation of control parameter in particular. The typical singular attractors of the system are described. The possibility of existence of full synchronization regime is shown for each of type when the signal has the excellent secure characteristics. The conditions of the increasing of secure degree by means of mixing with additional chaotic signal are proposed.</p>
