<p>Measurements of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic (DIC) carbon concentrations in rivers were conducted for 8 large watersheds of the Central Siberian Plateau, which differ in the degree of continuous permafrost coverage, mean annual air temperature, and the proportion of tundra and forest vegetation. DOC was the dominant component of C released to rivers. Like for other rivers of the pan-arctic region, relatively short snowmelt dominated annual fluxes of DOC and DIC as well as river runoff. In the study area, DOC and DIC fluxes were negatively correlated with the distribution of continuous permafrost and positively correlated with mean annual air temperature. A synthesis of literature data shows similar trends from west to east, with an eastward decrease of dissolved C concentrations and an increased proportion of DOC in the total dissolved C flux.</p>
