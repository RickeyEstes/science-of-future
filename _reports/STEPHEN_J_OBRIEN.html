<p>The Theodosius Dobzhansky Center for Genome Bioinformatics at St. Petersburg University  was established in late 2011 to develop capacity in Russia for human gene discovery, comparative  genomics , conservation of threatened species , ethical enhancement of data access, and advanced training in genome bioinformatics. Today the Center has  built several bioinformatics web platforms that : 1.)automate analysis and replication of genetic determinant that influence complex disease like cancer and HIV-AIDS (GWATCH);  2.) collate and analyze gene variants that influence pathogenesis among Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains across Russia ( GMTV); 3.) annotate genic and epigenetic features of assembled vertebrate whole genome features (GARField); and additional genome bioinformatics applications.  Our team of 30 genome bioinformaticians wok together to develop innovative bioinformatics approaches and to train a new generation of genome scientists.  My presentation will illustrate these advances with present projects and accomplishments in these important biomedical areas.</p>
