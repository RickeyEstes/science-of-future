<p>Method of microcalcifications detection in the breast tissue is studied both theoretically and experimentally. Calcium salts deposited in soft tissues often form the clusters of individual microparticles. Motion of particulates dispersed in the viscoelastic medium is studied. Particle displacement is induced by a radiation force generated due to scattering and absorption of energy of the ultrasonic beam focused in the area with the particles. Radiation force operates during 0.2 ms, after which the medium with distributed particles relaxes to its original state . The process of medium displacement is measured by a cross - correlation method with use of the short probing pulses at a frequency of 5 kHz . The presence of rigid microparticulates in the medium leads to a change in the character of the medium motion under the pulsed ultrasound exposure: the duration and amplitude of the displacement increase compared to a homogeneous medium.</p>
