<p>Long-term GHG flures monitoring has been made at the Experimental Forest Station of RTSAU in frame of the project №11/G34/31/0079 with special attention to recreational impacts and meso-relief forms. The research was carried out in five key representative sites along a transect extending from NE to SW with different levels of recreational impact. Results revealed high spatial heterogeneity and seasonal dynamics of GHG fluxes, as well as their factors - soil temperature and moisture. N2O fluxes ranged from 1.7 mg N2O m -2 day-1 to 1 mg N2O m -2 day-1. High N2O fluxes characterized contrasting sod-podzolic on a small moraine hilltop and bog-podzolic soils on gentle slope. Maximum N2O sink was observed in bog-podzolic (-0.7 mg N2O m -2 day-1). The main factors influencing soil CO2 fluxes are soil temperature (r = 0.81) and moisture (r = -0.45). Soils of all studied sites were a sink for methane, the average seasonal fluxes varied from 0.2 to 0.9 mg CH4 m -2 day-1. Determined in frame of the project regularities of GHG fluxes’ spatial and temporal variability, will be very useful to detailize the characteristics of the regional balance in the Central Region of Russia.</p>
