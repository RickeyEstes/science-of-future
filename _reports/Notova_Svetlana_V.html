<p>The paper studies the adaptive features of the human body using bioimpedance method. Besides the analysis of the element status of the human body was researched. The study involved 47 girls. The first group included girls without parental care, the second group consisted of girls brought up in families. Age 17-20 years was surveyed. The study found that the weight of girls of the first group was at 6.2% more than in the second group. Mean body mass index of the first group of girls did not differ from the second group (8.6%). Thus, a tendency to reduce the total liquid content and total body water in the second group of respondents were found. Some features of the element status were determined.<br><br>
The study was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (project â„– 262).
