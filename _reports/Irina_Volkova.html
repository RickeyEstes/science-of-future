<p>Environmental changes in mountain regions on the South of Western Siberia manifest themselves in dynamics of various components and features of unique and poorly studied mire ecosystems. It especially concerns mire massifs with permafrost in the peat deposit as, in this case, the ecosystem changes are connected not only with the climate, but also with dynamics of thermokarst processes.</p>
<p>Mire flora and vegetation, peat stratigraphy, botanical composition of the peat as well as interrelations to the local environment were studied at one of mire massifs with permafrost in the peat deposit in central part of Altai mountains, south of Western Siberia. The methods of geobetanical relev√©s (that means full-floristic vegetation samples), fine-scale geobotanical and landscape mapping and peat coring were used. The full landscape-ecological characteristics and the description of the mire landscape dynamics connected to the environmental changes resulted from the research. The assessment of the modern state and stability of the mire ecosystems under conditions of anthropogenic press and climate change is given. It is noticed that the mire massifs in the mountains are mostly sensible to the environmental changes as well as to the direct anthropogenic impact.</p>
