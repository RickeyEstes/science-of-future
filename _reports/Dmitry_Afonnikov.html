<p>The evolution of miRNA genes was found to be one of the key factors in the formation of the modern type of human. In this work we carried out the analysis of the evolution of miRNA genes in Homo sapiens sapiens (H.s.s.), Homo sapiens denisova (H.s.d.) and Homo sapiens neanderthalensis (H.s.n.) using an improved version of the H.s.d. and H.s.n. genomes. In both H.s.d. and H.s.n. genomes, we identified miRNA genes with unique substitutions. We estimated regulatory potential of these miRNAs using computational approach.<br><br>
It was demonstrated that the mRNAs targeted by miRNAs with mutations specific for Homo sapiens denisova exhibited an enhanced expression in the brain areas crucial for speech development in modern man. By contrast, the expression of mRNAs targeted by miRNAs with polymorphisms under selection in Homo sapiens neanderthalensis was not shown to be enhanced in the brain.<br><br>
