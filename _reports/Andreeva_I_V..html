<p>In Europe and Russia there’s a trend of rapeseed increased cultivation for human conception and biodiesel production too. In second case rapeseed can be grown on contaminated soil. Also, raps belongs to family Brassicaceae, which has many species with metal accumulating properties, which gives rapeseed additional potential for phytoremediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals. This paper presents the experimental results of phytoextraction capacity of two spring rape varieties in the conditions of Pb, Cd and Zn contaminated soddy-podzolic soil. Maximum uptake coefficients of Pb, Cd and Zn by plants were estimated to be 0,02; 1,97 and 3,10 respectively at the single treatment rates 550, 20 and 800 mg/kg soil. Rapeseed can be used as a phytoremediator of the soils contaminated with zinc. Presence of heavy metals resulted in lower yield of oil, but composition of fatty acids were not affected. Oil produced in these conditions can be used in technical purposes. Essential increase of the phytoremediation effect can be achieved through application of new complex N-Ca-S fertilizer (+15-40%) due to positive Ca impact on soil exchange capacity and positive feedback of S nutrition.</p>
