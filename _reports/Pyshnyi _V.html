<p>The comprehension of the variety of RNA roles in a cell has widened dramatically within last few years. There occurred an understanding that the RNA molecule is the most important target when trying to achieve a therapeutic response on a cellular level. This makes the development of new strategies, modulating the distinct RNA functions, extremely important. One of such strategies, which acts in direct manner, is the use of oligonucleotides, which are able to bind specifically to a target RNA molecule and modulate its function<br><br>
The aim of the project is to develop antimicrobial and antiviral therapeutics, based on use of oligonucleotides derivatives capable to modulate bacterial and viral RNAs.<br><br>
This work was partly carried out with support for research projects implemented under supervision of world leading scientists (agreement No. 14.B25.31.0028).
