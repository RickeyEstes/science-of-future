<p>There is a strong need of advanced materials in modern road construction. So far, the most used building material for pavements is the bituminous concrete. The existing production facilities are mostly for this type of concrete. Obviously, it is preferable for newly developed materials to utilize the existing production cycle; thus, the modification of traditional binder (bitumen) have to be considered as a promising direction during design the advanced materials for pavements. The sulfur-bituminous concrete (sometimes called sulfur-advanced asphalt concrete) – constructional composite with matrix formed from sulfur and bitumen mix – is one of such materials; to eliminate some negative technological aspects of the sulfur-bituminous mix (emission of the toxic gases) we had earlier proposed the special admixture. There was a lack of essential knowledge concerning mechanical properties of the sulfur-bituminous concrete with mentioned admixture; therefore, we had carried out the necessary examination. It is revealed that new material satisfies local regulations in terms of compressive and tensile strength, shear resistance and internal friction.</p>
