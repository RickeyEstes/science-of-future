<p>We demonstrate multiple optical trapping and manipulation of microscopic non-spherical light-absorbing particles in air using a single focused Hermite-Gaussian laser beam (TEM10, Î»=457 nm, output power is 2 W). Three-dimensional movement of trapped agglomerates of carbon particles is implemented. The structure of the intensity distribution of Hermite-Gaussian beams enabled the implementation of simultaneous trapping and movement of microparticles on two parallel trajectories in space (Figure 1). The particles were trapped in the area of high intensity. This can be explained by the combined effect of photophoretic forces, radiation pressure forces and gravity forces. Also, in experiments it was found the particles were trapped both before and after the focal point of a focusing microobjective (Figure 2). These results may be useful for a variety of research in the field optics, biology, chemistry, medicine.</p>
