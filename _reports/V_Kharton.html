<p>YBaCo4O7+? - based phases and their derivatives attract a significant attention due to their potential applications for oxygen sorption and electrode materials, and to very unusual structural and magnetic properties. In the low-temperature range YBaCo4O7-based compounds are thermodynamically metastable, but can absorb large amounts of oxygen without phase decomposition at least up to 870 K. The present work is centered on the magnetization measurements, evaluation of chemically-induced lattice strains, computer modeling of the oxygen intercalation processes using the molecular dynamics (MD) and static-lattice simulation (SLS) approaches, and 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy of YBaCo4-xFexO7+? (x = 0-0.8, 0.02 ? ? ? 1.5). </p>
<p>Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetization studies of YBaCo4-xFexO7+? (x = 0-0.8) oxidized at 0.21 and 100 atm O2, indicate an increasing role of penta-coordinated Co3+ states when the oxygen content approaches 8-8.5 atoms per formula unit. Strong magnetic correlations are observed in YBaCo4-xFexO8.5 from 2 K up to 55-70 K, whilst the average magnetic moment of Co3+ is lower than that for ? ? 0.2, in correlation with the lower 57Fe3+ isomer shifts determined from Mossbauer spectra. The hypothesis on dominant 5-fold coordination of cobalt cations was validated by molecular dynamics modeling of YBaCo4O8.5. The iron solubility limit in YBaCo4-xFexO7+? corresponds to approximately x ? 0.7. The oxygen intercalation processes in YBaCo4O7+? at 470-700 K, analyzed by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry and controlled-atmosphere dilatometry, lead to unusual volume expansion opposing to the cobalt cation radius variations. This behavior is associated with increasing cobalt coordination numbers and with rising local distortions and disorder in the crystal lattice on oxidation, predicted by the computer simulations.</p>
