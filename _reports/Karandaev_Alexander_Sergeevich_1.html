<p>The research is aimed to develop and bring into production the complex of the scientifically and conceptually correlated technical solutions providing energy savings at the energy production at the own power plants, distribution in the electric supply systems and consumption by the most powerful consumers. The research scientific work results in new awareness of the ways and methods to reduce losses at the electric power production by means of the utilization of the secondary energy resources of the iron and steel work. The principles of the interaction between the in-plant electric networks and external energy system have been studied. New methods, algorithms and technical solutions providing reduction of the electric power losses and energy consumption of the most powerful consumers have been developed. </p>
