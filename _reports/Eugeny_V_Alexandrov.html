<p>In the last 25 years, the concept of design of coordination networks was developed and raised on the highest level. The main advances have been achieved with developing of new efficient crystallochemical approaches that make possible to predict and characterize structures of new compounds for diverse functional materials [1-8]. This approach started with pioneer works of A.F. Wells in 1954 [9] became after about 40 years the subject of investigation for many researchers from around the world [1-8]. In the 1990s, it was implemented for the design of new coordination networks [1]; in the 2000s, enormous number of coordination networks with great variety of properties were synthesized [4], and the 2010s is the time for applications, and new theoretical studies [7, 8]. At present more than 30000 different coordination networks are known [10, 11]. Their detailed crystallographic investigation produces a great deal of information stored in international crystallographic databases like CSD [10] and ICSD [11]. Until a dozen years ago, these data were used only as a reference manual [12]. However, with creating new computer tools for crystallochemical analyses (http://topos.samsu.ru/), the databases became a valuable source for finding general and particular regularities and relations like composition-structure-properties in crystal chemistry and materials science [7]. From the point of view of modern crystallochemical approach, structure of coordinationnetworkscan be considered at various levels of their supramolecular organization [7]. Four general levels are following [13-18]:</p>
<p>1. Level of complex groups, which corresponds to the structure of mononuclear coordination centers and ligands.</p>
<p>2. Level of secondary building units for describing the structure of polynuclear complex groups and clusters.</p>
<p>3. Level of the overall network topology, which is determined by long-range topological order for binding of structural groups, considered at the 1st and 2nd levels.</p>
<p>4. Extranetwork level, at which inclusion of chemical species, interpenetrating or polycatenated networks, solvent molecules and other network guests are considered. Here mutual orientation of different components in the network ensemble can be analyzed and described.</p>
<p>Crystallochemical analysis shows regularities to be intrinsic to each level [7, 13-19].</p>
<p>1. There are strong correlations between coordination characteristics of components and topology of mono- and polynuclear complex groups (local topology).</p>
<p>2. Local topology predetermines the range of possible ways for topological organization of complex groups into networks (overall topology), while geometrical (stereochemical) characteristics of the groups connected by strong and/or weak interactions influence the realization of a particular network embedding.</p>
<p>3. Composition, local and overall topology of host andguests, as well as internal interactions within the coordination networksaffect its electrical, magnetic, optical, mechanical,and sorption properties as wellcatalytic activity.</p>
<p>From the results, a lot of useful conclusions, applications and correlations come into the view and can be specified with quantum chemical computations [17, 19].</p>
