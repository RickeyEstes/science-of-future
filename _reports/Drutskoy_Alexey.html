<p>During the last decade a new experimental technique based on photon detection using Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) readout is becoming more commonplace in high energy physics experiments. Compared with other charged particle detection technologies this technique does not require any complex high voltage, gas or cooling systems. It combines a simple experimental setup with a relatively low price.</p>
<p>The SiPM technique is planned to be applied in the COMET experiment (J-PARC, Japan) and also in the future International Linear Collider (ILC) experiment. In this talk the Cosmic Veto System for the COMET experiment based on scintillator strips with SiPM readout is discussed. Also the results of R&D studies performed for future ILC experiments are reported, for which the SiPM technique is planned to be used in both the hadron calorimeter subdetector as well as the muon system.</p>
