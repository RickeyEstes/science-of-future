<p>The scientists of BICEP2 telescope at the South Pole have announced the first results on detection of Gravitational Waves, in what would be a landmark discovery for the field of physics. Gravitational waves are the last chunk of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity that was predicted but not yet observed. Gravitational waves stared at the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The detection, which was made by the BICEP2, still needs to be confirmed by other experiments.</p>
<p>Several cosmology instruments (BOOMERanG, LSPE, MILLIMETRON, CORE) are being designed to measure anisotropies in the CMB. The Laboratory of</p>
<p>Cryogenic Nanoelectronics (LCN) with collaborators is developing the ultrasensitive Cold-Electron Bolometer (CEB) with a unique combination of high sensitivity, high dynamic range and insensitivity to Cosmic Rays. We are providers of CEB arrays for the BOOMERanG-3 and LSPE telescopes. We are developing with Rome University the Fourier Transform Spectrometer with CEBs for the Russia-led MILLIMETRON Space Observatory. We are developing the new generation multifrequency systems for the COrE European space telescope.</p>
