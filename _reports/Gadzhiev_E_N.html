<p>Aspectuality is the main direction of semantic research, which in recent decades developed in the field of general linguistics or material of individual languages​​. Semantic scope of the aspect is not yet fully understood, but it is the main characteristic of action in terms of its flow. In domestic linguistics aspectuality treated as functional-semantic category, which unites multilevel linguistic means. In the center of this category are tense verb forms and ways of expressing aspectual values. This issue has received considerable attention in the works of the researchers of the grammatical structure of Turkic languages​​, and yet still aspectuality attracted the attention of scientists and may not be solved in terms of turkologic. Category aspect is a phenomenon that has received in various Turkic languages, different developments and forms that are grouped under the name of "species", often in different languages, different values​​, different nature and scope of use. In general, modern aspectology achieved considerable success, especially in clarifying basic concepts and aspektologic relevant terms in the method of analysis of linguistic facts, determining the aspectual semantics in the description of aspectual contexts and situations. It is time to critically reflect on the results made ​​to generalize the theoretical and practical development of Turkic and determine the status of the category dimension in modern Turkic languages.</p>
