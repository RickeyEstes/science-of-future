<p>The regional wave forecast system work operationally on the server "Cray" in Natural Risk Assessment Laboratory (Lomonosov MSU, Faculty of Geography). The wave forecast based on the SWAN wave model with GFS wind forcing (0.5Â°, 3 hour). Computations were performed by using special unstructured mesh, which contains 8443 nods with changing spatial resolution from 10 km in open sea to 200 m in Tsemes Bay. Verification of wave forecast we made by comparison model results with instrumental wave measurements in Tsemes Bayon depth 22 m. Statistical analysis results of comparison contain the period February 2012 - December 2012. We can conclude that in generally wave forecast is good (errors in wave height lower than 0.5-1 m) and swan model work correctly if the wind forcing is fine. But in some cases spatial resolution of GFS forecast is too rough for regional wave modeling and in near future we are going to use WRF forcing.</p>
