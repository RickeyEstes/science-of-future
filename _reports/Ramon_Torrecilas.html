<p>Ultra Stable Materials (USM) are materials that have a null thermal expansion or controlled low thermal expansion coefficient. Such property coupled with its outstanding mechanical behavior (high mechanical resistance and stiffness) makes them critical for applications that require thermal and mechanical stability.</p>
<p>The key point in the development of USM materials is the use of SPS technology allowing its consolidation into dense materials starting from ceramic materials with different nature and as a consequence very different melting points, avoiding undesired solid-state reactions.</p>
<p>This talk presents the most outstanding results obtained during the last years in different ceramic systems including electroconductive carbon nanofiber based nanocomposites and oxide and oxide-non oxide nano composites. Some examples of these new materials in different application fields will be presented.</p>
