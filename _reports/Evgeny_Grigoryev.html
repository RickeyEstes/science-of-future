<p>Emerging technologies of field-assisted powder consolidation are studied and further advanced at the Key Laboratory for Electromagnetic Field Assisted Processing of Novel Materials at Moscow Engineering Physics University. New constitutive models of spark-plasma sintering taking into account thermal and non-thermal mechanisms of material transport are explored based on fundamental experimentation and computer simulations. Ultra-rapid field-assisted break-through consolidation technologies are developed for the processing of hard and super-hard materials. New technological routes of the fabrication of functionally structured powder components, including ODS steels and mono-nitride powders by spark-plasma sintering are established. Novel multi-scale thermo-mechanical model of high-voltage electric discharge consolidation of conductive powders is developed. New hybrid field-assisted sintering techniques are elaborated.</p>
