<p>Polymeric micelle drug carriers were invented a quarter of century ago. Today this technology has reached a clinical stage. Nearly a dozen of drug candidates based on polymeric micelles undergo clinical trials and one product, Genexol-PM, a polymeric micelle paclitaxel, was approved for cancer therapy in South Korea. The value proposition of currently developed polymeric micelle drugs include increased drug solubility, increased extravasation and targeting to disease sites (e.g. tumors) as well as increased drug activity with respect to multidrug resistant cancers and cancer stem cells (CSC). One class of polymeric micelles is small aggregates (10 to 100 nm) formed by amphiphilic block copolymers. Hydrophobic drug molecules incorporate in polymeric micelles through cleavable covalent bonds or non-covalent interactions. Latest developments in this field include poly(2-oxazoline)-based polymeric micelles that can carry unprecedented high loading of hydrophobic drugs, such as paclitaxel, as well as blends of several insoluble drugs. Such formulations have much lower toxicity compared to conventional formulations, which use high amounts of unsafe excipients to dissolve poorly soluble drugs. Consequently, novel polymeric micelle formulations can be administered at much greater doses and are more efficient in killing cancer cells. Another class of polymeric micelles incorporates charged drug molecules and macromolecules by forming electrostatic complex with ionic block copolymers. In this format the incorporated molecules entrap into the polyion complex cores of micelles where they are protected from the biological environment by non-ionic water-soluble polymer shell. Upon reaching the target destination the micelles disintegrate and released their payload. This technology is now being used with chemotherapeutic agents, pDNA, siRNA and proteins. For example, extensive studies focus on the use of such systems for delivery of therapeutic enzymes (nanozymes) to the brain and other disease sites. In selected cases the nanozymes are loaded into macrophages, which safely transport them to and then release at the sites of inflammation during disease. The proof of the principle has been obtained using animal models of stroke, hypertension, Parkinson’s disease, eye inflammation, influenza virus infection, spinal cord injury, and other diseases. Our recent work in this area has focused on remote magnetic field actuated nanomaterials based on the polymeric micelle incorporating superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs). SPIONs can mechanically disrupt macromolecules attached to their surface as a result of forces created by their motion in low frequency non-heating alternating current (AC) magnetic fields, which induces the realignment of the particles along the field. The magneto-mechanical actuation of polymeric micelles at the nanoscale has been demonstrated, which opens possibilities for design of futuristic nanoscale drug delivery systems that can be remotely actuated within the body.</p>
