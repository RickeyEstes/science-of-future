<p>We study localization of zeros of functions from de Branges spaces. This question is motivated by the theory of canonical systems of differential equations. In particular, we prove that de Branges spaces with the localization property are in one-to-one correspondence with the canonical systems of special type, namely, those whose Hamiltonians consist only of indivisible intervals accumulating on the left.</p>
