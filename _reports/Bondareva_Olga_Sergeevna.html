<p>Design of new biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery is actual task of regenerative medicine at the present time. There is a problem of sustained release of drug from scaffold.
</p>
<p>In this work we propose the method of modification electrospun scaffold by including spherical calcium carbonate microcontainers CaCO3 into fibers.</p><p>The SEM images of received samples are shown Fig.1.</p>

<p>It was found that the most intensive growth of the coating thickness is observed at the Si content about 0.1 wt.% and more than 0.3 wt.%.</p>
<img src="../img/tezis/Sergeevna2.png">
<p>Research has shown that with increasing Si content up to 0.1% instead of the dense phase layers (Fig. 2a) the loose and thick coatings are formed.</p>
<p>The compact layer of qualitative δ phase becomes thin and discontinuous. The outbursts of brittle ζ crystallites are observed (Fig. 2b).
</p>
<p>When the Si content is 0.77% the morphology of ζ crystallites is changed from columnar to dendritic (Fig. 2c).</p>
<p>The results of the study allow to explain the reasons of the coatings poor quality on steels containing Si.</p>
