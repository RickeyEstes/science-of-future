<p>With increasing interest to nano- and micro- crystal structures, the precision methods and techniques of their observation and analyse are needed. One of the powerful instruments of studying such structures is an x-ray diffractometry.</p>
<p>We performed an x-ray reciprocal space mapping of the Si-Genano-heterostructure by using compound refractive lenses(CRL)[1] as a Fourier transformer[2](Pic. 1), providing a high angular resolution in two dimensions, which is crucial to characterize the periodic order and crystal structure of the Si-Genano â€“ heterostructure (Pic.2).</p>
<p>The Si-Genano-heterostructure is 100 nm Genanocrystals on free-standing 90 nm wide and 150 nm high Silicon(100) pillars with a periodicity of 360 nm along the (110) crystal direction. These nano-heterostructures were realized on a Si (001) substrate using the CMOS gate spacer process in IHP laboratory Frankfurt (Oder), Germany.</p>
<p>The experiments were conducted at the ESRF ID06 beamline (Grenoble, France).</p>
<p>The obtained reciprocal space map provided the information about Si-Geheterostructure orientation, periodicity, crystal structure and stress distribution.</p>
<p>The advantages of the used technique are:</p>
<p>- Possibility to perform time resolved experiments (like surface acoustic waves)[3]</p>
<p>- The high resolution in reciprocal space (~1 urad)</p>
