<p>We will report on the development of laser-based nanomanufacturing technologies for applications in photonics and medicine. Fabrication of 3D nanostructured objects by two-photon polymerization (2PP) of photosensitive materials, generation of microstructures and nanoparticles by laser ablation, and direct laser printing of nanoparticle arrays will be discussed. Applications of these techniques for the realization of photonic and plasmonic components, sensors, biomedical implants, and tissue engineering constructs will be demonstrated.</p>
