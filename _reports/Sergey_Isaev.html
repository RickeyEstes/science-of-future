<p>Project objectives: </p>
<p>1. To establish a multidisciplinary laboratory – a center for development of computational technologies of numerical simulation of physical and technological processes, to verify technologies using physical experiments, to make complex numerical and experimental studies according to the chosen research subjects: aeromechanics of vehicles, thermal physics of cooling systems for internal combustion engines, ventilation of a driver’s cab.</p>
<p>2. To develop the methodology, the structure and the content of a special code.</p>
<p>3. To approve, estimate the code accuracy and efficiency by the classical test examples, 2D and 3D problems using ERCOFTAC, special experiments.</p>
<p>4. To conduct fundamental and applied studies of aeromechanics and thermophysics of vehicles:</p>
<p>4.1. Vortex control of flow around vehicle models using the theory of optimal control and with regard to disturbing factors.</p>
<p>4.2. Heat transfer and hydraulics of elements and assemblies of systems of cooling.</p>
<p>4.3. Ventilation of a driver’s cab due to the control of flow, heat transfer, moisture using the methods of optimal control within the framework of the energy saving strategy. </p>
