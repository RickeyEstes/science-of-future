<p>In 2010, the Laboratory of Chemical Design of Bionanomaterials was established at the Lomonosov Moscow State University. Main activities of the laboratory were directed to fundamentals and applications of new classes of bionanosystems based on proteins, enzymes, polymer coatings, magnetic nanoparticles for treatment and diagnostics of a number of diseases of the central nervous system, brain, neurotoxic injury, eye inflammations, bacterial infections, etc.</p>
<p>Using the technology of NanoZYMES™ for therapeutic proteins immobilization and functions (USP WO №2008/141155 A1), novel types of nanomateroials developed. Among them:</p>
<p>Organophosphate hydrolase containing nanozymes possessing the ability to decompose organophosphorus neurotoxins were developed and studied on chemical warfare agents and pesticides in vivo using different ways of administration into the body: intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally and buccally. As revealed, it is possible to use these formulations both as effective antidotes and protectants. The absence of cytotoxicity and immunogenicity was shown. As found, the dosage of these formulations can be lowered be dozens of times comparing to the conventional antidotes used worldwide.</p>
<p>New formulations of antioxidant nanozymes based on superoxide dismutase were developed and used for eye inflammation and spinal cord injury treatments. Significant improvement in the course of immunogenic uveitis was shown on rabbits. Histological studies have proved the clinical and biochemical data. These results demonstrate high potential therapeutic efficacy of SOD1 nanozyme to treat a wide range of inflammatory diseases in the eye. SOD1 nanozymes were shown to be safe in terms of survival rate for animals with spinal cord injury, and their administration improved recovery dynamics of rat’s voluntary movements. </p>
<p>Bacteriolytic nanozymes effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were prepared and used as antibacterial agents. As an example, nanocompositions of enzymes from bacteriophage phi 11 and K with block-copolymers, effectively lysing of antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, having high stability and decreased (2-10 times) toxicity, were investigated and characterized.</p>
<p>Hybrid nanomaterials containing enzymes and superparamagnetic nanoparticles with a magnetic core and a gold shell were designed. Effects of low frequency magnetic fields on the conformation and the catalytic activity of enzymes attached to the surface of magnetic nanoparticles, which is the first example of a mechanical-magnetic effect in nanobiocatalysis, have been studied. These studies offer the possibility of using superparamagnetic materials for remote monitoring the different biochemical processes.</p>
