<p>The explosive growth in inorganic and organic materials chemistry has seen a great upsurge in the synthesis of crystalline materials with extended framework structures (zeolites, coordination polymers, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), supramolecular architectures formed by Hydrogen bonds and/or Halogen bonds etc.). There is a concomitant interest in simulating such materials and in designing new ones.  In the last two decades there have been many parallel outcomes in the theoretical aspects of description and analysis of periodic structures (nets, tilings, surfaces, etc.), in the elaboration of databases, and in the development of software for analysing and describing topological aspects of both real crystal structures and theoretical extended architectures. The most general program package is ToposPro developed by us (www.topospro.com). We will show some recent results in MOFs, zeolites, molecular crystals, intermetallics, and hypothetical allotropes.</p>
