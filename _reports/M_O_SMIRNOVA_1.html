<p>The last few decades have witnessed a monotonic increase in the number of cancer patients. About 70% of these are sever cases that required radiotherapy. Radiation therapy is a powerful tool in cancertreatment. One type of cancer radiotherapy is neutron capture therapy (NCT).</p>
<p>This work describes the experimental investigation of NCT based on pharmaceuticals containing 10B. One of the important tasks during radiotherapy is the control of the absorbed dose in the tissues of the patient. For the estimation of the absorbed dose we have employed a technique based on the registration of prompt Î³-rays with energies of 478 keV, which arise as a result of nuclear radiative capture reactions of thermal neutrons by 10B.</p>
<p>We will present estimates of the registration efficiency of the scintillation detector LaBr3(Ce), and the anticoincidence detector LYSO. The results of simulations to determine the absorbed dose in an aqueous solution of pharmaceuticals are also presented.</p>
