<p>Specifics of sports training in the conditions of different types of sports do not break the rhythmic organization of intensity of growth processes, but promotes a shift of terms of the puberty fluctuations in growth rates.<br>
Age dynamics of the PWC170 and MPK is associated with the dynamics of somatic development, i.e. the heterochronic nature of development of functional readiness of an organism is observed. We have revealed that young athletes have earlier domination of activity of a parasympathetic link of regulation and the favorable combination of centralization and autonomy of a heart rhythm control against development of high level of physical working capacity.<br>
During the puberty jump of growth at boys, irrespective of a mode of physical activity, tension of regulatory systems is observed. The age of 12 years is shown to be the nodal period of ontogenesis in formation of vegetative mechanisms of the heart activity regulation.
