<p>Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. The glutamate receptors are classified into two types: ionotropic glutamate (iGlu) receptors and metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. While the iGlu receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, the mGlu receptors belong to the class C of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) family. Group I mGlu receptors (mGlu1 and mGlu5) are predominantly localized in the postsynaptic density and are coupled to G?q G-proteins. Since the identification and characterization of the mGlu receptors, significant effort were spent to understand the pharmacology and medicinal unity afforded by these subclass receptors.</p>
<p>This work is a continuation study of the regioselectivity aromatic nucleophilic substitution in isothiazole ring. The highly regioselective SNAr amination reaction at C-5 of the readily accessible 3,4,5-tribromoisothiazole is discovered. The reaction proceeds with a range of primarily and secondary aliphatic amines in DMSO in the presence of copper salts as a catalyst. Other positions of isothiazole ring do not participate in the transformation. No reaction with anilines was observed. In contrast to bromoisothiazole, iodo-group at C-5 suffers protodeiodination in the reactive condition.</p>
<p>The discovered reaction opens the short way to synthesize compounds that possess high selectivity to different receptors of group I mGlu (mGlu1 and mGlu5).</p>
