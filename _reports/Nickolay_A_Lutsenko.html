<p>The work is devoted to the numerical modeling of the combustion and other energy sources in porous media which may arise as a result of natural or man-made disasters. Porous media in terms of mechanics are soils, peat, debris of ruined buildings, solid waste dumps, etc. Combustion of porous objects can appear after explosions at industrial plants, after destruction of buildings, in underground explosions, after self-ignition of peat or solid waste dumps and so on. The zones of energy release in porous media, which differ from combustion sources, arise, for example, after the explosions at nuclear power plants (like Chernobyl NPP).</p>
<p>In the present work it has been shown that the mathematical models of both combustion and other energy-release process in porous objects can be very similar, since they can be based on the classical approaches of the mechanics of heterogeneous continua. Numerical algorithms for the simulation of these processes have been developed which are very similar too.</p>
