<p>In a research-university the crucial intersection of education and research is when research is being carried out by MSc and PhD students, as well as young post-docs. This has led to the creation of graduate schools and researchschools and, in general, to increased attention to the development of young people through PhD training for a variety of positions in current-day society. The subject will be presented from the perspective of a physicist having experience with the Delft-Leiden Casimir research school.</p>
