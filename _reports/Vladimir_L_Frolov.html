<p>In the report results obtained in experiments carried out at the Sura heating facility (NIRFI, N. Novgorod, Russia), which are defined some features of artificial ionosphere turbulence (AIT) induced in the ionosphere by modification of its F2-region by means of O-mode powerful HF radio waves, are presented.</p>
<p>The following features of the AIT are considered in the report:</p>
<p>•	AIT features at different stages of interaction between powerful HF radio waves and ionosphere plasma;</p>
<p>•	Temporal evolution of artificial ionosphere irregularities and their spectral characteristics;</p>
<p>•	Features of plasma perturbations HF induced in the upper ionosphere at altitudes of ~ 700 km;</p>
<p>•	Spatial structure of the ionosphere disturbed volume;</p>
<p>•	Gyro features of AIT generation;</p>
<p>•	Features of stimulated electromagnetic emissions;</p>
<p>•	Generation of AGWs by periodical ionosphere pumping.</p>
