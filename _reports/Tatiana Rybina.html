<p>To optimize the collection and processing of expedition materials we have developed a software complex «SIS GEO Technology». The program interface is created in the programming language Java, based on the Tablet PC Samsung gt-n8000 with Android-4 operating system.</p>
<p>Using the program is simple and easy:</p>
<p>1. During the planning phase of expedition works you can write the task in the Tablet PC which includes:</p>
<p>- the points on maps that you need to visit and collect information,</p>
<p>- template, as a list for collection information.</p>
<p>In addition, you can create different types of geotagging, which allows quickly search for grouping objects on the map. You can load user-created thematic maps, photos.</p>
<p>2. In expedition conditions the researcher needs only to reach the points and collect information on the template.</p>
<p>3. Information that is collected on an expedition comes from the Tablet PC on the server part. Server designed for storage, information processing, upload report in MS Office.</p>
<p>The program was tested by us in the environmental audit: to identify areas of death tree plantations as a result of flooding, burnt area, the area of oil-contaminated sites, placement of unauthorized dumps. Using this program, we get report of expedition studies quickly and very informative.</p>
<p>In the future, the program will be developed for a wide range of professionals who works in the expedition conditions.</p>
