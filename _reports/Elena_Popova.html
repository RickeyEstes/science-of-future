<p>The one of the main goals of the project “High energy physics and nuclear medicine with silicon photomultiplier detectors” is development of SiPM's applications in medicine, namely for TOF-PET, SPECT and Gamma-spectrometer for neutron capture therapy.</p>
<p>Russia’s domestic medicine is suffering from a crippling deficit of modern equipment for diagnostics. Almost all of this equipment was imported. Most of them are operated for more than 10 years and are now needed to be either modernized or completely replaced.</p>
<p>Our project includes experimental studies used to develop equipment and technology for modern PET and SPECT scanners and Gamma-spectrometer based on novel SiPM’s.</p>
<p>The parameters of SPECT tomography scanners based on the standard vacuum photomultipliers (PMT’s), which are used in human body diagnostics systems with gamma-radionuclide methods, have almost reached their technological limits. Further development of SPECT scanners is only possible in the case where SiPM's are employed as a detection element.</p>
<p>An additional opportunity appears for combining the gamma tomography scanner with magnet-resonance tomography scanner (MPT) technology, improving significantly the ability and quality of the medical diagnostics. Such a combination permits simultaneously drawing data about both human anatomic and functional behaviors.</p>
<p>Very promising idea is to use SiPM in PET systems utilizing the time-of-flight technique, especially when applied to medical diagnostics. Because of the small size and strong electric field in the active area, SiPM has excellent timing parameters.</p>
<p>Our study involves simulation and experimental activity with developing prototypes of SPECT and PET modules. The latest obtained results will be presented.</p>
