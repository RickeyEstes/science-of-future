<p>2-Dithiophosphato-substituted aldehydes (1) are the new type phosphorus containing ones. They are perspective syntones in synthesis of polyfunctional P,S-, N,P,S- containing organic compounds. We synthesized aldehydes (1) by hydrolisis of corresponding immonium salts obtained of N-alkyl-2-chloroaldimines and O,O-dialkyldithiophosphates.<br> 
Aldehydes (1) react with non – and substituted primary amines, hydrazines and hydrazides to give the corresponding imines and hydrazones containing the acetal, hydrazide, cellular phosphite and phosphorylated sterically hindered phenol fragments. They also interact with N,N-and N,O- nucleophiles to form 3-(O,O-dialkyldithiophosphatomethyl)perhydrodiazoles and oxazoles. The compounds synthesized contain varions pharmacophoric groups and therefore they are potential biologically active substances. The composition and structure of the products obtained were confirmed by elemental analysis data and 1H and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.<br>
