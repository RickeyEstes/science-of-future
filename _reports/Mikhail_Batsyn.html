<p>In this talk we present a real-life vehicle routing problem for delivering goods from a warehouse to stores of a big retail company. There are about 500 stores and 100 vehicles for one warehouse. This problem differs from the classical Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) by the following properties:<br><br>
1. Each store has its limitations on vehicles which can serve it (Site Dependent VRP) <br><br>
2. The company has a fleet of different vehicles with different capacities, fixed and variable costs (Heterogeneous Fleet VRP) 
3. Vehicles have trailers (Truck and Trailer RP) <br><br>
4. Each store can be served by two or more vehicles (VRP with Split Deliveries)<br><br>
5. Each store has a soft time window defined by preffered time of delivery and a hard time window defined by its opening and closing times.<br><br>
So instead of classical CVRPTW we have HFTTRPTWSD - Heterogeneous Fleet Truck and Trailer Routing Problem with Time Windows and Split Deliveries. We discuss how to model all these constraints and include it to exact and heuristic algorithms.</p>
