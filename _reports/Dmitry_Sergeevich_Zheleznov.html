<p>In the last years a large number of promising laser media has appeared. It is induced by rapid developing of laser and optical ceramics production, allows to get optical elements faster, cheaper, larger; to made the ceramics from the materials, which are technologically impossible to be grown in a single crystal form. The comprehensive investigation of media properties (thermo-optic, spectral) is relevant for laser systems efficiency improvement, new types of lasers creation. The measurement of material constants and its dependences on temperature, wavelength, the concentration of the active ion etc. for new materials allow its properties optimizing and obtaining the unique characteristics of the optical elements for advanced lasers.</p>
<p>During the first half of mega-project period, 5 measuring and 2 technological facilities were made and tested. More than 10 papers were published, the Russian patent was received.</p>
<p>Facilities are embedded in the IAP RAS work for scientific purposes and for students laboratory workshop.</p>
<p>The results level meet or exceed the best world-wide advances in diagnostics of optical media, creating composite optical components.</p>
