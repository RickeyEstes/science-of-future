<p>The developed in frame of the project # 11.G34.31.0079 regional environmental monitoring system for greenhouse gases analysis RusFluxNet includes seven flux towers (which is 2 fold increase comparing to before the project on whole European territory of Russia) covering south-taiga, sub taiga and forest steppe zones, natural and urban forests, cropland, bog and natural steppe conditions. High-frequency (10-20 Hz) tower data are accomplished with the results of the chamber measurements at soil-pant level, covering the spatial variability in the representative ecosystems. GIS and remote sensing application allows transferring the local monitoring results to similar landscapes and agroecological areas that is crucial to successful interaction of RusFluxNet data analysis with European and global-scale GHG and climate change models. Well-elaborated monitoring collaboration with the principal natural preserves in south-taiga and forest-steppe regions provides process-based interaction with long-term data on zonal climatic, landscape and soil features necessary to test models and technologies in the specific conditions of each bioclimatic zone.</p>
