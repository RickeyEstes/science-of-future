<p>The work is implemented as a part of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science Task, project № 33.1684.2014/К<br><br>
Ethnoarcheology is a scientific discipline combining the research methods and sources of both archeology and ethnography.<br>
It develops in Russia in the following directions:<br>
- The comparison of archeological and ethnographical materials (ethno-archeological comparisons);<br>
- The research of the widespread (universal) phenomena of the world culture – routes of communication, nutrition structure, social structure of traditional societies and so on.<br>
- Ethnoarcheology in the view of L.R. Binford, his colleagues and disciples (western ethnoarcheology);<br>
- The study of ethnographical-archeological complexes (EAC) of the Russians, the Tatars and other peoples of Russia.<br>
The results of the analyses prove that the last direction is the most dynamically developing one. At the same time, the research in the other directions stays at the same level or even decreases.</p>
