<p>One of the most important aerodynamic parameter of the helicopter is its drag. Partially, this drag caused by fuselage and its components – tailplane, landing gear, etc. Figure 1 shows results of isolated fuselage and it`s components drag research performed by Aerodynamics lab of KNRTU-KAI for early version of ANSAT helicopter fuselage (designed by Kazan Helicopter plant).

<p>Helicopter`s main rotor is another big part of the entire object. Figure 2 shows results of research performed by KNRTU-KAI in collaboration with TSAGI for isolated helicopter`s main rotor. Object of this research was induced speeds distribution near the main rotor blade`s tip. For this application, two measurement systems were used – PIV (based on photometric principle) and LDA (based on Doppler`s effect).</p>
