<p>The work is implemented as a part of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science Task, project № 33.1684.2014/К</p>
<p>A regular study of the burial rite of the Russian Siberians was resumed in the beginning of the 1990-es. The following directions can be noted down:</p>
<p>1) the one related to the source studies, with the focus on the material components of the rite, as well as the ratio of the peculiarities of the locally recorded rite and the ethnic composition of the population;</p>
<p>2) the historiographical one. As a result of the academic literature analyses, a conclusion was made, that the burial rite has been studied as a part of the spiritual culture of the people;</p>
<p>3) the methodical one. There have been elaborated new techniques of material gathering: instrumental and visual shooting of cemeteries, continuous monitoring of cemeteries.</p>
<p>The study of the burial rite allows for the solution of more general problems of Russian ethnography: which elements of culture of different groups of the Russians are more consistent, how the Russian Siberian culture has been building up, how big is the variety of local forms and whether the Russian Siberian culture exists as a unified phenomenon.</p>
