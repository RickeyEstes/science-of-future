<p>We have performed a study of elastic properties of asphaltene films on glass substrates and asphaltene coated water droplets. Such films has been studied extensively by many researchers in recent years to obtain a better understanding of complex nature of crude oil. Because of their amphiphilic nature, asphaltenes play a prominent role in the extraction and utilization of hydrocarbon resources. In our study the atomic force microscope was used for high-resolution imaging of asphaltene films and for determination of their elastic properties. The Young’s modulus for asphaltene film was found to be of 23.7±0.8 MPa and for coated water drops of about 20 kPa. The model of a linear viscoelastic membrane by Barthes-Biesel&Sgaier was applied for the estimation of resistance to breakup of droplet of water-in-oil emulsion. The application of other theoretical models known in literature for analysis of obtained data are discussed.
