<p>The analysis and design of structures normally requires accurate computer-intensive calculations using numerical (discrete) methods. The field of application of semianalytical (disctere-continual) methods, that are now becoming available for computer realization, comprises structures with regular physical and geometrical parameters in some dimension. Solution of corresponding resultant systems of equations with immense number of unknowns is the most time-consuming stage of the computing, especially if we take into account the limitation in performance of personal computers, contemporary software and necessity to obtain correct solution in a reasonable time. However, in many cases it is impractical to obtain high-accuracy solution for the entire structure. It is commonly known that defects and failures are mostly local in nature and stress-strain state specifically in these regions of structure with well-known location is of paramount importance. Wavelet analysis provides effective and popular tool for such researches. This paper is devoted to multilevel wavelet-based discrete and discrete-continual methods of local structural analysis.</p>
