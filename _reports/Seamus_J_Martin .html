<p>Interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines play major roles as initiators of inflammation and are frequently among the first cytokines produced in response to infection or injury.  IL-36alpha? IL-36beta?and IL-36gamma are the most recently identified members of the extended IL-1 family and have been strongly implicated as key initiators of skin inflammation, particularly in psoriasis. Individuals that carry hypomorphic mutations in the IL-36 receptor antagonist display a severe and highly debilitating form of psoriasis, called generalized pustular psoriasis.  This suggests that deregulated IL-36 cytokine signaling is sufficient to drive aggressive skin inflammation and also that IL-36 is an important barrier cytokine.  Furthermore, analysis of IL-36 mRNA expression in skin biopsies from individuals with the most common form of psoriasis, psoriasis vulgaris, found dramatically elevated expression (100-fold) of all three IL-36 transcripts compared with non-lesional skin from the same individuals, or non-affected controls.  Thus, neutralization of IL-36 activity in the skin may be of significant therapeutic benefit for inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis.  Similar to the other members of the IL-1 family, IL-36 cytokines are expressed as inactive precursors lacking secretory signals and require proteolytic processing for activation. Therefore, small molecule inhibitors of the proteases responsible for activation of IL-36 cytokines could have significant potential as therapeutics, through blocking the activation of the latter cytokines.  We have developed an in vitro assay for protease-dependent IL-36 activation.  Using in silico screening of small molecule libraries, we are pursuing the identification of inhibitors of IL-36 processing and activation that may serve as novel anti-inflammatory agents.</p>
