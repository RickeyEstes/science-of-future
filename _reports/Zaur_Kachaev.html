<p>Poly(A)-binding protein – interacting protein 2 (paip2) represses mRNA translation in cytoplasm. It was shown to be important in regulation of synthesis of specific key proteins in spermatogenesis, as well as in regulator of long-term synaptic plasticity in mouse. We study function of this protein in Drosophila. Our data indicate that paip2 is involved in mRNA biogenesis starting from its synthesis in cell nucleus. Using several techniques we have detected paip2 on early stages of mRNA synthesis. Thus, molecular functions of this factor is wider that it was known previously.</p>
