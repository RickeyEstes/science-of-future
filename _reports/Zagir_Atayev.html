<p>Results of the study suggest that the recruitment of the proposed qualitative and quantitative parameters of lowland-foothill landscapes of the Northeast Caucasus be placed on separate classification unit. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the conditions of formation and functioning of landscapes and nature of climatic conditions contact foothills. Moisture conditions within these landscapes vary from dry steppe to the forest, which is not typical of high-altitude zonal landscapes of the Caucasus mountain structure and zonal plain landscapes Ciscaucasia.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the materials were used for the protection and restoration of natural resources, improve the network of protected areas; as a basis for assessing the potential of doing and optimization of agricultural, forestry, water management, and tourist and recreational use of the territory; to create a landscape inventory, planning and environmental protection measures in the further development of the area, improving the system of territorial environmental monitoring.</p>
