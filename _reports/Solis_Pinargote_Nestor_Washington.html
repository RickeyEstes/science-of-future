<p>This work presents a process of technological preparation of powders in order to modify them and obtain a superhard ceramic cutting tool from the nanocomposite material Al2O3-TiC-Ni.</p>
<p>Alumina powders, nickel oxide and titanium carbide were used as substrates and as a consequence of technological preparation of this powders, the grain boundaries of the high-purity alumina powder are modified by segregation of the Nickel(II) oxide phases and by the formation of well-distributed Titanium carbide nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The presence of these phases at the grain boundaries (GBs) drastically affects the evolution of the microstructure, and the properties of the resulting materials.</p>
<p>Thus high dense composites with microstructures formed by an alumina matrix and a very homogeneous distribution of nanophases can be obtained by using spark plasma sintering (SPS) technology. SPS provides a high rate of solidification of the powder composition and high quality and uniform distribution comes be achieved using significantly lower sintering temperature than in other sintering methods.</p>
<p>The nickel content in the final product was limited to 2%, and 25% for titanium carbide. Titanium carbide content was selected to be 25 vol.% for being a concentration over the percolation threshold (fc ~ 16 vol.%). This concentration of the third phase in the form of nano-sized titanium carbide provides the necessary electrical conductivity of this superhard material and consequently suitable for electrical discharge machining.</p>
<p>This composition and method of sintering allows to obtain nanocomposite with required properties of wear resistance and conductivity with high hardness (HV = 25,6 ± 0,7 GPa), flexural strength (σf = 537 ± 88 MPa) and density (ρ= 4,27 ± 0,01 g/cm3).</p>
