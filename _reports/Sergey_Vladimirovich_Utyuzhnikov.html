<p>An applied computational package has been developed at the FlowModellium laboratory. It can be used for computational modelling of chemically and thermodynamically non-equilibrium hypersonic flows and heat/mass transfer. Free-molecular, transitional and continuum flow regimes for real-life configurations of space vehicles can be simulated using unified physical and mathematical models. The distinguishing feature of the package is a unique combination of accurate and efficient numerical methods together with the inclusion of real non-equilibrium physics in the wide range of flow regimes of hypersonic vehicles. The further research concerns development and implementation of high-accurate methods for modelling of turbulent flows and active flow control.</p>
