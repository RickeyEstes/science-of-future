<p>The feedwater pump’s main terminal stud bolt connection is one of the most important sites in reactor construction. This article shortly describe the method of probability calculation of it's limited depressurization or destroy. This method is based on the probability theory. It also uses the result of nondestructive control and material’s mechanical properties.</p>
