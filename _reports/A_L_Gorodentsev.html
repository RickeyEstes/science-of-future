<p>Abelian Lagrangian Algebraic Geometry (ALAG) is a geometric framework for understanding an interaction between the symplectic and algebraic geometries in the context of geometric quantization. It comes back to the last works of Andrey Tyurin (see [GT]‚Äì[T4]). I will give a review of the main concepts of this theory, recent developments, and open questions, focusing mostly on nonabelian theta-functions and generalized Knizhnik‚ÄìZamolodchikov equation.</p>
<p>Namely, let 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold (M, ÔÅ∑) admit simultaneously a structure of real completely integrable system, i.e. lagrangian toric fibration</p>
<p>ÔÅ∞: MÔÇÆÔÉ±ÔÅÑ (1)</p>
<br>
<p>over a Delzant polytope ÔÅÑ ‚äÇRn, and a structure of polarized K√§hler manifold M1, where I is an integrable complex structure on TM. Assume for simplicity that there is a hermitian line bundle L on M that becomes holomorphic and ample on M1 and has c1(L)‚àà H2 (M,Z) rationally proportional to the canonical class K1 of M1 and to the class [ÔÅ∑ÔÄØÔÅ∞ÔÅ©] provided by the symplectic structure.</p>
<p>For example, M can be a projective toric variety, or an algebraic abelian variety, or a moduli space of holomorphic vector bundles on a Riemann surface of genus g, e.t.c.</p>
<p>The real polarization (1) produces n-dimensional family of lagrangian cycles  on M. ALAG explains that one should expect in this family a finite number of Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld cycles (i.e. those S for which L|s has global covariantly constant trivializing section). This holds in all examples listed above.</p>
<p>Another important construction of ALAG (called BPU-mapping) attaches to each Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld cycle a holomorphic section of L on M1 defined up to multiplication by a non-zero complex constant. In all examples above the sections coming from Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld fibers of (1) form a basis of H0(M, L).</p>
<p>When the complex structure I varies along the moduli space M  of polarized K√§hler structures on M, the spaces H0(M, L) fill a holomorphic vector bundle M   over M  . Each real polarization (1) provides projective bundle ‚Ñô(M  ) with canonical flat connection whose horizontal constant sections are those coming from Bohr-Sommerfeld fibers of (1). This construction generalizes Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation and (usual) theta-functions, which appear when ùëÄ turns to Jacobian of an algebraic curve (i.e. to the moduli space of topologically trivial holomorphic line bundles on a Riemann surface).</p>
<p>Different real polarizations (1) of a fixed symplectic manifold M  often form an interesting combinatorial structure. For example, when M  is the moduli space of topologically trivial holomorphic vector bundles of rank 2 on a Riemann surface ‚àë of genus g ‚â• 2, then essentially different lagrangian fibrations (1) stay in bijection with ¬´pants decompositions¬ª, i.e. scissions of ‚àëinto pants by 3g  ‚àí 3 simple pairwise non-isotopic loops. These decompositions form a famous graph whose edges are elementary regluings of pants. Each polarized K√§hler structure I on M equips the edges of this graph with transition matrices between Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld bases in H0(M, L) coming from polarizations (1) staying at the vertexes. I my talk I will try to explain the details of this picture as far as the time allows.</p>
