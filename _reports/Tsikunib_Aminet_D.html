<p>On the basis of physiological, biochemical and hygienic studies it is established that iodine deficiency (ID) is a factor limiting athletes’ physical efficiency. Thus, athletes with ID show higher (by 37.7%) baseline levels of lactate in the blood, its increased accumulation (by 19.4%) after a standard exercise and lower utilization rate during the recovery period. This research has revealed a phenomenon of the "working hypoglycemia” stimulating gluconeogenesis and lactate utilization, which is less pronounced at athletes with ID. It has been found that ID reduces physiological indicators of physical fitness of athletes. It is proved that power drinks against intensive physical activities increase iodine losses by an organism by 22.5±3.8% and reduce efficiency of a power exchange. The model of optimization of the iodine status on the basis of an "iodine-saving" diet is developed.</p>
