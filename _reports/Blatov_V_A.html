<p>The problem of developing artificial intelligent systems in materials science is considered. A prototype of the expert system that can predict the structure and properties of coordination polymers as well as molecular crystals is created and discussed. The expert system consists of two main components: 1) a knowledge database that contains correlations between chemical composition, geometrical-topological parameters and physical properties of crystalline substances and materials, and 2) an inference machine that asks the user for the initial data on the material, analyzes them with the knowledge database, and outputs a conclusion about possibility and conditions of synthesis of the material. The knowledge database of the prototype includes the information on chemical composition, geometrical and topological features of more than 20000 coordination polymers and molecular compounds as well as numerous correlations between them. The efficiency of the inference machine of the prototype was successfully tested with some examples of both already synthesized and newly obtained chemical compounds. The routes to create expert systems for other classes of materials are briefly deemed.</p>
