<p>Research in educational settings shows that one of the most powerful effects on learning is feedback on performance. The dynamic nature of effects of feedback, its neurophysiological mechanisms and individual differences in reaction to feedback remain very poorly understood. We used EEG method to investigate brain correlates of mathematical learning and response to feedback in a sample of N=32. University students over the course of 5 days. Behavioural results showed that feedback was a powerful component of learning. EEG analyses identified neurophysiological signatures of learning in the presence and absence of feedback. Future planned research will combine EEG method with transcranial electrical stimulation to further characterise the dynamic nature of learning. This combined EEG and TES paradigm will be embedded into the genetically sensitive twin design in order to investigate the nature of individual differences in neurophysiological underpinnings of learning.</p>
