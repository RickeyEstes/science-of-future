<p>Mortality from toxic shock, caused by LPS (bacterial lipopolysaccharide) and other microbial components, remains a major health problem. The toxicity of LPS is mainly caused by excessive synthesis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other inflammatory molecules by macrophages in response to LPS and resulting massive death of the cells. I am interested in inflammatory responses to LPS and TNF in vitro and in vivo and in characterization of the mechanism by which inflammatory genes induce cell death in the context of pathogenic infections. In my lab, we are using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to identify new mediators of this deadly process and to establish its contribution to the onset of sepsis-like conditions in mouse models. To identify genes that confer responses to septic shock, we are using classical genetic analysis in mice and evolutionary divergent wild-derived mice as a genetic model. These mice exhibit inflammatory respond to but do not die from LPS. By employing genetic mapping in wild-derived mice, we have recently identified novel roles of several regulators of inflammation and cell death such as ubiquitinase CYLD. Next, we described novel function of molecule FLIP, which is important inhibitor of apoptosis and necroptosis, an alternative to apoptosis cell death. Our approaches in vitro involve gene expression analysis of LPS response by means of high throughput next generation sequencing (NGS). Using NGS RNA-sequencing approach we characterize novel pathways and gene networks activated in response to LPS. These findings will provide important insight on regulation of innate immune pathways and will expand our understanding of biology of inflammatory signaling.</p>
