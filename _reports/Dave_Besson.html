<p>I will summarize progress of our MEPhi-based group over the last year in advancing science in particle physics, astroparticle physics, and nuclear medicine. Much of this work is centered on applications of Silicon Photomultipliers, which hold promise as next generation photo-detectors, owing to their compactness and robust operation in the presence of magnetic fields. Details of our group's effort are provided in individual contributions to this conference.</p>
