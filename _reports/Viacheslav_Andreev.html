<p>Developed photovoltaic installations consist of high efficiency III-V nanoheterostructure solar cell with concentrator of solar energy and sun tracking system. The main advantages of these installations are as follows: </p>
<p>- efficiency of about 40% in multijunction solar cells at conversion of the concentrated sunlight; </p>
<p>- intermediate concentration (up to 800x) of the sunlight by means of the Fresnel lenses and proportional decrease in solar cell area and cell specific cost; </p>
<p>- more than in 2 times increase in electric power amount generated by a concentrator array; </p>
<p>- decrease in two-three times the quantity of consumable materials necessary for concentrator installations. </p>
<p>The investigations are carried out in the frame of Megagrant â„– 14.B25.31.0020.</p>
