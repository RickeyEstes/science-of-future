<p>The solid carbide end mills are in extensive use during manufacturing of aviation parts made of hard-to-machine materials.</p>
<p>The application of end mills, which were developed for machining Russian materials would promote the evolvement of Russian tool industry.</p>
<p>The development of the range of solid carbide end mills for hard-to-machine materials is described in the present paper. The State Standards can be used as the source of geometric parameters, but it does not have the particular values for finishing or roughing end mills, besides the recommendations for the design and geometric parameters are general.</p>
<p>The research of design and geometric parameters measurement of 10 end mills of various international manufacturers is reflected in this work.</p>
<p>It is necessary to follow the certain algorithm of choosing and conformance of parameters to develop the end mill. Also it is essential to know that the design is directly connected to manufacturing technology. The fig.1 shows the different rake face of end mill’s cylinder with the diameter of 12 mm and different flute depths, while the wheel form remains the same.</p>
