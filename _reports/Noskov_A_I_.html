<p>A laboratory for additive technologies has been set up in Kazan National Research Technical University (KNRTU-KAI), together with the engineering center "KAI-Laser". The labcarries out research in the field of "additive manufacturing" under the agreement â„–14.Z50.31.0023 between the Ministry of Educationand Science of the Russian Federation and Federal State Educational Institution of Higher Professional Education KNRTU-KAI, with its research being supervised by Prof., Dr. of Engineering Michael Schmidt.
The main tasks of the laboratory involve training of qualified specialists and scientific-pedagogical personnel on the basis of the latest achievements in the field of additive manufacturing, creation of multi-component materials, high-tech products and competitive models of new technology. 
</p>
<p>The Lab is supposed to contribute to the development of the international concept of additive manufacturing technologies and provide principles of their implementation for the manufacture of a wide range of products and functional samples for a variety of industrial applications.</p>
<p>Examples of successfully implemented projectsare the laser hardening project and set-up of the Center for medical science "Eidos"</p>
