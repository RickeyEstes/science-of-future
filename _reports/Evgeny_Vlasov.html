<p>The transition from the liquid phase alkylation of isobutane with isobutene to heterogeneous catalysis solves the problems of corrosion and disposal of used acids. Among the heterogeneous catalysts are promising zirconium sulfate composition (SZ).</p>
<p>In this paper, optimized technology and composition of SZ-catalysts.</p>
<p>Samples were prepared by mixing the ?-A12O3 with Zr(SO4)2; sulfating - processing H2SO4; extrusion; heat treatment at 400°C for 3 hrs. Alkylation was performed in flow reactor at 6 bar, 80°C, the space velocity of the isobutane and isobutene 3 and 0.15 s-1, respectively, of the catalyst volume -15 cm3.</p>
<p>With increasing ratio of ZrO2/A12O3 =30/70-84/16 is formed macroporous structure (specific surface area 4-6 m2/g, the volume of meso-0.02 and macropores to 0.36 cm3/g) with the Gammets function 4,8; yield fraction C5-C8 wherein increased from 43.5 to 81.9 wt%.</p>
<p>Work performed under the grant from the Government of the Russian Federation ¹14.Z50.31.0013.</p>
