<p>Superconducting devices are very suitable for the detection of THz radiation as has been demonstrated for astronomical instruments on the ESA Herschel Space telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. For future instruments the attention has switched to microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). This demanding application raises a number of inetrtesting questions about the performance of superconducting materials in response to microwave signals, used fro read-out, and the absorption of THz photons. We will show how in this case practical application needs fundamental understanding.</p>
