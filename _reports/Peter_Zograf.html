<p>Enumerative problems arising in various branches of mathematics, from graph combinatorics to algebraic geometry, often have much in common and the corresponding generating functions enjoy remarkable integrability properties. Grothendieck's "dessins d'enfants" count provides a typical example of that kind, whose generating function satisfies Virasoro constraints, an evolution equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy and the topological recursion. </p>
