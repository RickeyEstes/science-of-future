<p>In 2014, the authors of the report conducted a case study (n = 900) on the topic "The attitude of Tomsk residents to migrant workers" which resulted in the following conclusions. Most Tomsk residents are tolerant to migrant workers, yet intolerant judgments exist; they are localized among the less educated and low-income segments of the population.</p>
<p>Tomsk residents demonstrate predominantly neutral attitude to the presence of migrant workers. According to the majority, the urban economy can do without the use of migrant labor, but migrant workers take jobs the locals do not want. However, respondents note the excess of migrants in Tomsk, their criminalization, and advocate for tougher immigration policy and immigration restriction.</p>
<p>As a result, we can speak of a delicate balance in the attitude of the local population towards migrant workers â€“ they do not cause any obvious irritation at present, but in case their number increases, or the socio-economic situation deteriorates, we can predict the growth of intolerant attitudes and ethnic tensions.</p>
