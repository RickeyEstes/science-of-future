<p>Soviet engineering school influenced significantly the system of training in information technology (IT) and computer sciences (CS) in contemporary Russia. The fact that many graduates from Soviet and post-Soviet universities hold high positions within the best IT-companies and Computer Science departments all over the world indicates the strong traditions of technical education. </p>
<p>Although universities, departments and chairs has gone through drastic changes since Soviet period, Russian computer scientists and IT-professionals are still visible on the global surface. Russian CS and IT are well-know all over the world. They are visible, and it seems that local Russian professional communities of both IT and CS in different countries are somehow interconnected. The study of these real and virtual networking helps us understand the professional diaspora. </p>
<p>The paper is to show what happens with Russian computer scientists (RCS) and IT-professionals (RIT) in London â€“ their migration strategies, career paths, social activity, and future plans. There is a presupposition that there is a local professional community of RCS and RIT in (and around) London.</p>
