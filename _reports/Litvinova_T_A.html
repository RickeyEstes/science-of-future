<p>The problem of oil-containing waste utilization is considered, sources of their origin are revealed, amount of annually being generated and stored waste are analysed, and ecological assessment of impact waste on the environment is carried out. We have developed the bases of resource saving technologies for minimizing oil-slimes, exhausted sorbents and catalysts pollution. It is offered the complex solution of third class hazardous waste neutralization by reagent capsulation. To ensure ecological safety it is used exhausted silica gel and sorbent ODM-2F as a silica component in neutralizing composition. To identify environmental contamination by waste and products of its utilization it is developed the method for determination of pollutants concentration in water by quantitative thin-layer chromatography using a densitometer Sorbfil. Joint neutralization waste will provide recycling valued components by receiving environmentally safe organo-mineral additives suitable for use as secondary material resources in construction industry. The study was supported by The Ministry of education and science of Russia.</p>
