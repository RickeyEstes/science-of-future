<p>The current work focuses on the experimental study of the influence of the loading system stiffness on the behavior patterns of the structural metals (carbon steel and aluminum-magnesium alloy) at the inelastic deformation stages by using the original specimens with complex geometry. Estimation of the heterogeneous strain fields on specimen surface was carrying out by the 3-D non-contact digital image correlation (DIC) measurement system.</p>
<p>The main aim of the present investigation is to study the temporal instabilities and spatial localization due to the Lüders behavior, the Portevin–Le Chatelier effect and the shoulder effect during uniaxial tension tests; to investigate the effects of the macroscopic localization processes due to the serrated flow.</p>
<p>This study presents the brief description of the test procedure and new experimental results of research by using the flat samples with two L-shaped holes. The procedure provides managing the properties of the loading system by means of attaching the additional deformed parts to the samples, which enables us to study the effects of the spatiotemporal inhomogeneity of the inelastic deformation.</p>
<p>The work was carried out at the PNRPU with support of the Government of RF (The decree № 220 on April 9, 2010) under the Contract № 14.В25.310006, on June 24, 2013.</p>
