<p>The unique optical properties and low losses make dielectric nanoparticles perfect candidates for a design of high-performance nanoantennas, low-loss metamaterials, and other novel all-dielectricnanophotonic devices. The key to such novel functionalities of high-index dielectric nanophotonic elements is the ability of subwavelength dielectric nanoparticles to support simultaneously both electric and magnetic resonances, which can be controlled independently for particles of non spherical forms.</p>
<p>We propose a new type of highly efficient Yagi-Uda nanoantenna and introduced a novel concept of superdirective nanoantennas based on silicon nanoparticles. In addition to the electric response, this silicon nanoantennas exhibit very strong magnetic resonances at the nanoscale. Both types of nanoantennas are studied analytically, numerically and experimentally. For superdirective nanoantennas we also predict the effect of the beam steering at the nanoscale characterized by a subwavelength sensitivity of the beam radiation direction to the source position.</p>
