<p>The modern Siberian Tatars are a conglomeration of different ethnic components from which three big groups can be singled out: the locals –different Turkic – speaking groups, the Boukhartsy – people of various Central Asian descents, and the aliens – different groups of the Volga and Ural Tatars. As a result of the activity of the Russian and the Soviet state the identities of the Turkic – speaking population settled in the south of Siberia were changing. Simultaneously, during a long time there cohabited group self-nominations, estates and ethnoconfessional definitions some of which have become ethnonyms (exo - and ethno-). The transformation was happening during the whole chronological period. At the level of ethnogenetic conscience, based on the materials of the genealogies gathered, various variants of ethnic identification of the Siberian Tatars are discovered.<br><br>
