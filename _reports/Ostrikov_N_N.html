<p>The problem of noise generation by turbulent flows is currently one of the most complex problems in fluid dynamics. This complexity stems, on the one hand, from essentially non-stationary character of noise generation mechanisms (NGMs), and on the other hand, from the fact that energy of acoustic perturbations comprises ~0.01% of kinetic energy of the turbulent flow, which renders identification of turbulent flow NGMs extremely difficult. To distinguish the sources that radiate sound in the farfield from non-radiating turbulence, it is necessary to develop special methods based on fundamental understanding of basic NGMs. Thus, the objective of the project consists in development of methods of identification of turbulent flow NGMs and application of these methods in laboratory and full-scale tests to decrease aircraft noise, which is a very urgent problem for modern Russian civil aviation due to ever-stringent norms imposed on community noise by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).</p>
