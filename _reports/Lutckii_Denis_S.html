<p>The investigation aims to recreate and modernize the national production of rare earth metals (REM), as associated components, modernization of the existing technologies used in different stages of REM treatment, production of highly qualified personnel in this field, which corresponds to the current state and prospects of development of scientific and technical complex of the country</p>
<p>The fundamental study of REM phosphate crystallization from metastable supersaturated solutions. Obtaining of the brand new data in the physical and chemical laws of crystallization in metastable systems on seed materials allowed to develop crystallization technology of REM extraction on seed matrices from industrial phosphates and fluorides solutions.</p>
<p>Planned construction of an industrial plant producing concentrate REM that should improve the comprehensive utilization of apatite concentrate, reduce the cost of the main product and waste production.</p>
