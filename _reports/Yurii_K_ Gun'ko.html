<p>Over last years the area of chiral metal nanoparticles (e.g. Au and Ag) has received a great deal of attention due to the range of potential applications offered by these materials in chiral sensing and as metamaterials in advanced optical devices. Recently, the use of stereospecific chiral stabilising molecules has also opened another avenue of interest in the area of quantum dot (QD) research. The main goal of our research is to develop new types of technologically important quantum dot materials containing chiral defects, study their properties and explore their applications. For the first time chiral penicillamine stabilised CdS QDs have been prepared by us using microwave induced heating with the racemic (Rac), D- and L-enantiomeric forms of penicillamine as stabilisers. Circular dichroism (CD) studies of these QDs have shown that D- and L-penicillamine stabilised particles produced mirror image CD spectra, while the particles prepared with a Rac mixture showed only a weak signal. It was also demonstrated that all three types of QDs (D-, L-, and Rac penicillamine stabilised) show very broad emission bands between 400 and 700 nm due to defects or trap states on the surfaces of the nanocrystals. Similar CdSe and CdTe based chiral QDs have been produced and investigated. More recently we have developed a range of chiral ZnO, ZnS, ZnSe and ZnTe nanostructures. The utilisation of chiral penicillamine stabilisers also allowed the preparation of new water soluble white emitting chiral nano-tetrapods, which demonstrated circular dichroism in the band-edge region of the spectrum. Biological testing of chiral nanotetrapods showed a chiral bias for uptake of the D-Pen stabilised nano-tetrapods by cells. The chiral QD nanostructures have also been doped by various metal ions. It was found that manganese doping had a strong effect at low levels in the synthesis of QD based nanostructures We expect that this research will open new horizons in the chemistry of functional nanomaterials and their application in biotechnology, sensing and asymmetric synthesis.</p>
