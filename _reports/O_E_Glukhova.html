<p>One of the actual problems of translational medicine is target delivery and controlled release of bio-regulators. As a promising form of targeted delivery of various substances to tissues and organs can use microcapsules. Nowadays, the main problem consists in the controlled release of encapsulated materials near the predetermined areas. The purpose of this work is to develop a model of the nanocomposite membranes sensitive to ultrasound exposure. It is important to develop a model which permits to adapt the properties of the shell for a specific application. In program complex ANSYS five models of the microcapsules shell were created with various modifications. Modal and harmonic analysis of model of behavior shell microcapsules were carried out in water at a temperature of 37 Â°. As a result of numerical experiment the eigen frequencies were calculated for the first time and the mode shape for each model of nanocomposite microcapsules were defined.</p>
