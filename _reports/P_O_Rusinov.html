<p>The results of experimental studies on the formation of the surface layers of a material with shape memory effect (SME) based on TiNiCo deposition of Pb-Bi melt at a temperature gradient of 600-1100 °C in an argon atmosphere. It is shown that this method allows to obtain uniform surface layers in nanostructured state and almost any thickness can be used for the formation of coatings on the interior surfaces of products of any shape with the stress concentrators. Structure, chemical and phase composition of the surface layers provide a manifestation of TiNiCo shape memory. The average grain size of TiNiCo coatings ranges between 80 ÷ 190 nm.</p>
<p>Based on comprehensive metallophysical research of surface-modified layers (electron microscopy, spectroscopy, X-ray, calorimetric, durometric analysis) formed by precipitation from molten TiNiCo fusible metals at a temperature gradient, the possibility of the formation of nanoscale composition within the surface-modified layer is shown. Results of the study of microhardness, chemical and phase composition and its evolution at all stages of surface modification, defining functional properties allow to solve the problem of the purposeful formation of surface layers for different operating conditions. Use of the technology of forming of the surface layers by materials with shape memory effect with the creation of layered composites construction purposes will expand the range of applications in mechanical engineering.</p>
