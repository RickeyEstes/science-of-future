<p>The Project is directed on the creation of a new scientific Laboratory of Mechanics and Advanced Materials under supervision of Russian scientist Evgeny Lomakin (Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor of Lomonosov Moscow State University) on the base of Perm National Research Polytechnic University (PNRPU) under the Contract № 14.В25.310006, June 24, 2013 with the Government of Russian Federation. A good combination of intellectual resources, experimental and computational facilities of PNRPU and Federal State Research Institute of Continuum Media Mechanics of the RAS Ural Branch provides high-level fundamental scientific researches in Solid Mechanics within Advanced Mechanics of Structured and Functional Materials including the academic training of professionals in this area for students and postgraduates. The project stimulates a substantial development of science and education. The goal of the project is the creation of scientific foundations for solving problems of strength of materials, structural safety, searching for the ways to prevent emergencies determined by accumulation of structural damages and formation of conditions for loss of bearing capacity of structures. The research includes the development of breakthrough technologies for aviation based on the comprehensive experimental investigation and mathematical modeling of strength, durability, mechanisms of accumulation of damages and destruction of aircraft-grade alloys, polymer-fiber composites and constructions in wide range of temperature. Another goal is to obtain new knowledge about the phenomena of macro-localization of plastic yielding, regularities of processes of inelastic deformation and formation of conditions for damage of engineering materials based on the application of modern highly efficient noncontact equipment for the registration of the fields of deformations and temperatures.</p>
