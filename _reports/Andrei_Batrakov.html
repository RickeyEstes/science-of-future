<p>Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is advanced approach to helicopter design. Helicopter Multi-Block (HMB) is in house CFD tool developed to study aerodynamic performances of helicopter. This work is mainly directed to investigation of the flow around helicopter fuselage and rotor-fuselage interaction.</p>
<p>Numerical approach allows decreasing the cost of helicopter elements shape optimization in comparison with experiment. As an example of aerodynamic design task different shapes of helicopter fuselage rear part were considered to decrease the fuselage drag (fig.1.).</p>
