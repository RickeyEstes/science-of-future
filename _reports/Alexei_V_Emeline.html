<p>Absorption of light quanta by solid in heterogeneous systems turning it into electronic excited state results in numerous physical and chemical sequences of excitation decay [1, 2]. Physical events occur in wide time range: from femto-seconds to dozens of seconds. In case of comparable time scale for physical and chemical steps of photoexcitation decay, they interconnect and compete with each other. Therefore, the efficiency of the physical processes affects the efficiency of the chemical sequences and vice versa. Particularly we have focused our attention on:</p>
<p>1. Formation of active state of surface active centers</p>
<p>2. Decay processes limiting the life time of the active state of surface active centers</p>
<p>3. Effect of photoinduced color center formation and how it is affected by surface chemical processes</p>
<p>4. How the type (either photocatalytic or non-catalytic) of the interfacial photochemical process affects the photoinduced defect formation in the solid photocatalyst</p>
<p>5. Interconnection between chemical doping and intrinsic defects in photoactive solids</p>
<p>6. Secondary radical-induced chemical processes and chemo-stimulated excitation of photoactive solids.</p>
<p>Detailed analysis of the experimental results demonstrating the significance of the interplay between physical and chemical interfacial processes will be given during presentation. The deeper understanding of such interplay creates new ways for the developing of better photoactive materials and their applications.</p>
