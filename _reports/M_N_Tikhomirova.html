<p>Studying the ethnocultural traditions in the nutrition system of the Western Siberian Tatars determined by the peculiarities of their ethnical history allows for building a scheme of its formation and discover its local features.<br>
Settlers form Central Asia – the Siberian Bukhartsy – are one of the territorial – ethnic groups which build up the ethnos. Presently, some descendants of Tara and Tuymen Tatars still identify themselves as Bukharlyk or the Bukhara Tatars preserving their multilevel conscience. In their nutrition system, apart from common Tatar dishes, there can be noted some specialties which single them out of the whole massive of the Tatars.<br>
The common feature of both groups is a big share of meat and dairy products; also, there are some peculiarities of cooking and taking meals. Apart from that, they cook round baursaki (pastry fried in oil) and use oregano (Оriganum vulgare) as a component of the fasting soup.<br>
For the Tara group it is common to make a drink called sorbet and home khalva. Their vocabulary preserves Iranian names for dishes – shirpourek, naryn, nan. The descendants of the Bukhartsy of the Tyumen group cook flour - cream porridge (elva) and square noodles (tashlama/salma).</p>
