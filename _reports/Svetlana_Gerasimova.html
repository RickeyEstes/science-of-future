Modeling signal generation and processing in brain networks using electronic and optical components is one of modern directions in interdisciplinary research related to brain science. Such models are interesting for perspective design of devices for monitoring brain activity, methods for stimulation and therapies in biomedicine and biotechnologies.<br><br>
In this work we propose optoelectronic model simulating synaptic signal transmission between neurons. The synaptic interaction was implemented using a fiber optic communication channel presented in fig. 1. The output signal from the master (presynaptic) neuron is conveyed to the light emitted by a diode and sent into the fiber. At the end of the fiber the signal detected by a photodiode enters to the slave (postsynaptic) neuron. Such unidirectional signal transmission simulates the functionality of an excitatory synaptic coupling between living neurons. Synchronization regimes 1:1, 3:1 of signals of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron-like generators are observed in this work.<br><br>
