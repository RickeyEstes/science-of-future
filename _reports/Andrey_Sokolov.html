<p>Cryogenic Avalanche Detecors (CRAD) are referred to as a new class of noble-gas detectors operated at cryogenic temperatures with electron avalanching performed directly in the detection medium. In two-phase CRADs the primary ionization charge, composed of electrons produced in the noble liquid and emitte into the gas phase with THGEM multiplier. This kind of detectors have a large fiducial volume and an ultimate sensitivity, i.e. operated in a single-electron counting mode at extremely low noise. The field of application os such detectors is a direct observation of dark matter particles and the coherent neutrino scattering.</p>
<p>Consept of the such type detector was suggested in the our laboratory. Results of the tests of the prototype will be presented in the report.</p>
