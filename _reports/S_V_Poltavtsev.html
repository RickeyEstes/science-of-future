<p>The possibility to store optical information is important for classical and quantum communication. Atoms or ions as well as color centers in crystals offer suitable two-level systems for absorbing incoming photons. To obtain a reliable transfer of coherence, strong enough light-matter interaction is required, which may enforce use of ensembles of absorbers, but has the disadvantage of unavoidable inhomogeneities leading to fast dephasing. This obstacle can be overcome by echo techniques that allow recovery of the information as long as the coherence is preserved. Albeit semiconductor quantum structures appear appealing for information storage due to the large oscillator strength of optical transitions, inhomogeneity typically is even more pronounced for them and most importantly the optical coherence is limited to nanoseconds or shorter. Here, we show that by transferring the information to electron spins the storage times for the optical coherence can be extended by orders of magnitude up to the spin relaxation time. From the spin reservoir it can be retrieved on purpose by inducing a stimulated photon echo. We demonstrate this for an n-doped CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum well for which the storage time thereby could be increased by more than three orders of magnitude from the picosecond-range up to tens of nanoseconds.</p>
