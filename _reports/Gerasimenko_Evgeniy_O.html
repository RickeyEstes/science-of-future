<p>Grains and oilseeds are the main feedstock for the producing of a wide range of food products that make up the great part of daily diet, and have a significant impact on formation of nutritional status of the population of Russia.<br><br>
University scientists have developed innovative approaches to deep processing of grains and oilseeds based on the ideology of "green" technologies providing a comprehensive solution to these urgent problems:<br><br>
- Maximum use of native potential of raw material into high tech products. For example, for traditional for Russia oilseed materials - sunflower seeds - such approach involves producing the desired products as - physiologically valuable oils; edible protein; food lecithin, including individual fractions used as active pharmaceutical ingredients; liquid and gaseous biofuels and raw materials for the synthesis of organic compounds with pharmacological activity;
- Effective utilization of waste using advanced technologies of bioconversion, which will significantly reduce the load on the environment;<br><br>
- Reduction of power-consuming processes through reorientation from traditional methods of thermal activation to the alternative methods including electrical and biotechnological.<br><br>
Scientific value and relevance of investigations is proved by their funding under the grant support of RFBR, RHF, and by performing research in the framework of the Federal Program "National and pedagogical personnel of innovative Russia" for 2009-2013 with total funding of more than 10 million rubles, and under the Federal Program "Research and development on priority directions of scientific-technological complex of Russia” in 2014 - 2020 years, with a total funding of more than 100 million rubles.
