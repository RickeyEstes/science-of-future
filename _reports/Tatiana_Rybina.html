<p>The study of ecosystem change after the fire we spend using space images of different years. With their help, we highlight microlandscapes - stages of mire and perform measurements of their areas, hydrological properties.</p>
<p>The cause of fire we consider the destruction of convex forms of peatland. It is formed by a pine-shrub-sphagnum community, has a rigid skeleton of dense turf plants, spongy peat, and provides vertical lifting water.</p>
<p>The results are:</p>
<p>- The cause of fires in the marshes is the destruction of pine-shrubs-sphagnum complex. Its destruction leads to a reduction the level of the bog water and drainage of the upper layers of peat.</p>
<p>- After drainage is reduction of lakes in the swamp area, burning marsh areas.</p>
<p>- The most exposed to fire: ryam (peat thickness up to 1.5 m), swamp forests of mixed composition.</p>
<p>Perspective studies: assessment of the impact of amelioration and pyrogenic effect, through the identification of ecosystem dynamics (desiccation, flooding, species change, changing climatic conditions through dendrochronology, the productivity of O2, wood reserves, to develop recommendations for the construction work).</p>
