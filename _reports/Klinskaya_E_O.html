<p>The Jewish Autonomous Region (JAR) refers to the biogeochemical provinces with a deficit in the environment of such elements, as Ca, Mg, F, I, Se, Co, Cu and excess of Fe and Mn. Undoubtedly, the deficiency or excess of some elements or their combination may affect the health status of autonomy. And this can most clearly manifested in the use of drinking water.<br><br>
This research showed (2008-2012), that the average stiffness drinking waters of JAR lies ranges from 0.7 to 3.2 mg-eq/dm3, i.e. near the lower limit of the physiological norm of drinking water (1.5-7 mg-eq/dm3) or below the specified range.<br><br>
Range of average concentrations of fluorine in drinking water is in the range of 0.12-0.41 mg/dm3 (average 0.24 for all samples). The average content of fluorine in drinking water of autonomy almost 2 times less than its optimum content (0.8-1.2 mg/dm3).
Set high content of Fe and Mn in drinking water field (Table 1). Noted that only in some cases concentrations of Fe and Mn correspond to the MAC.<br>
Table 1
The average content of Fe and Mn in drinking water (mg/dm3) in JAR

Thus, long-term person residence in the territory with a low content of fluoride, in drinking water and high of Fe and Mn and low stiffness can lead to serious defections in the body.
Investigations are continuing.<br><br>
Abstracts were prepared with financial support of the Ministry of education and science of the Russian Federation with the state subsidy to perform the task № 2014/422 of SholomAleichemPriamurskyStateUniversity, the project № 485 «Influence of natural and non-natural factors on the health status of the Jewish Autonomous Region»
