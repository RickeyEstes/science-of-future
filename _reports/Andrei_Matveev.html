<p>Boron nitride nanostructures (nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanofibers, and nanosheets) represent an innovative class of nanomaterials with intriguing prospects of their utilization for structural and biomedical applications. Boron nitride nanomaterials (BNNs) have long been in a shadow of their famous rivals - carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphenes. While both nano-systems revealed equally excellent mechanical properties, BNNs possess chemical and thermal stabilities superior to those of C ones. The main goal of the project was to fabricate various BN nanostructures (nanotubes, nanosheets, nanospheres) and toutilizethem for the reinforcement of lightweight metallic matrices. In this presentation, our recent achievements in the high-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of BNNs are summarized.Different methods of metal/BNNTs composite material fabrications are described. We used bottom up approach starting from the mechanical characterization of individual BNNTs, followed by the mechanicalanalysis of BNNTs/Al nanohybrids, as well as bulky Al melt-spun ribbons and powder metallurgy producedpellets reinforced by BN nanotubes. Different issues concerning the surface functionalization of BNNsto improve their wettability and control interfacial interactions at the nano-BN metal matrix interfaceswere considered from the experimental and theoretical viewpoints. Available data in regards of the nature of BNNs binding with a variety of functional groups are highlighted. The range of confirmed and expected mechanical and functional properties makes BNNs an unprecedentedly interesting topic for the modern structural materials science.</p>
