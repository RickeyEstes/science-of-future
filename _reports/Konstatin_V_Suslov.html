<p>For a successful research in the technical science a modern basic laboratory structure is necessary. In the scope of the Mega Grant 220 № 11.G34.31.0044 (Project Baikal) the authors have developed and set into the operation a modern laboratory complex at the National Research Irkutsk State Technical University working in close cooperation with RAS and Siemens for investigation of Smart Grid Technology. Following research is possible in the founded labs:</p>
<p>Lab A Fuel Cell – investigation of PEM FC Membranes – material research</p>
<p>Lab B Multimedia & Simulation – planning of optimal power system including the 3D option, forecasting of renewable generation - operation research</p>
<p>Lab C Modern, Synchronised Measurements and Protection – planning of adaptive protection and testing of high resolution devices – research on ICT technologies</p>
