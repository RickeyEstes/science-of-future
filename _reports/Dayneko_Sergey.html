<p>Organic photovoltaic devices are increasingly replacing silicon solar cells. This has become possible in the context of a new promising trend in photovoltaics consisting in development of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. The composition and structure of the active layer where charge generation and separation occur are crucial characteristics of these cells. Traditionally, the active layer is fabricated from polymer/fullerene derivative hybrid structures. However, fullerene derivatives poorly absorb light in the visible region. In this connection, the use of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) as acceptors seems promising, because QDs are characterized by a wide absorption band, a high extinction coefficient, and the possibility of controlling the electron and hole energy spectra by varying the QD size.
The energy spectra and mutual affinity of the components of a nanohybrid solar cell are the key parameters determining the efficiency of light to electricity conversion in this device. Hence, the selection of the most suitable organic semiconductors (OSCs) and QDs is a prerequisite for increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic conversion. The purposes of this study was to develop nanohybrid materials composed of CdSe QDs and OSCs that could serve as components of highly efficient solar cells and to study the optical and electrophysical properties of these materials. We have studied the possibility of using CdSe QDs in combination with advanced low-band-gap polymers for designing bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. According to our data, both the relative positions of OSC and QD energy levels and the morphology of the active layers affect the efficiency of light to electricity conversion. The results of this study make it possible to correct the strategy of further development of hybrid solar cells based on semiconductor QDs and OSCs.</p>
