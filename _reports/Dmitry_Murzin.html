<p>Combination of reaction and separation in oil refining and petrochemistry can diminish or even eliminate recycling making current industrial processes much more efficient. Reactive distillation provides a number of advantages from kinetic and thermodynamic viewpoints. Moreovercombined processes can be even simpler as well as economically and energetically more favourable.</p>
<p>Reactive distillation proved to be effective in different types of chemical reactions (esterification, alkylation, isomerization, hydration, etc), however, based on experience with industrial and pilot plant processes it became apparently clear that combined processes cannot be applied in a straightforward manner to all chemical-technological systems. Therefore there is need to develop criteria of technological and economical feasibility in utilization of reactive distillation processes for particular chemical processes.</p>
<p>As examples of the proposed approach isomerization of light hydrocarbons and alkylation of isobutene with olefins will be considered.</p>
