<p>Physical events happening on the interface between the inorganic nanostructures and biological molecules or supramolecular biological systems holds interesting promises for development of new materials with unique properties for biomedicine, photovoltaics and biophotonics. Additionally, recently discovered, on the nano-bio interfaces, giant linear and non-linear optical effects related to the energy transfer from the nanostructures to biosystems not only capable to force the bio-component of such hybrid material operate better, but also paves the way to improvement of the efficiency of photosynthesis, biophotovoltaics, and to appearance of new materials for storage and transfer of information.</p>
<p>Here, an overview of fundamental discoveries and applied research of the last years in the field of development of nano-bio hybrid materials with the energy transfer properties will be presented with the special focus hold on the breakthrough achievements obtained in applications of these materials to ultrasensitive cancer diagnostics and disease treatment monitoring.</p>
<p>The last but not the least, the necessity of high responsibility of nanotechnological research and development will be pointed out and the key issues of toxicity of nanomaterials and potential risks of their industrial applications will be discussed.</p>
