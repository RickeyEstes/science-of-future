<p>The search of prevention and treatment methods of various diseases continues to be an actual in spite of significant progress in modern medicine. Qualitative diagnosis of diseases is necessary for early revealing of abnormalities in human's body, identifying risk factors for various diseases and prescription for competent treatment. Nowadays diagnostic of diseases and subsequent treatment connected with chromatographic methods in the most important way. This is due to the fact that the modern arsenal of chromatographic techniques is extremely wide and allows to separate complex multi-component mixtures and related to them biological material effectively and informatively.<br>
In the current research the GC-MS analyses of vaginal fluid had been done with a purpose to determine monosaccharides for diagnostic of the diseases and evaluation the effectiveness of prebiotic in monosaccharides from plant for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.<br>
The studies had been performed on the gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection, using a capillary column HP-5ms (30m*0.25mm*0.25Î¼m). In the process of work the best methods for sample preparation using the derivatizing agents had been selected, as well as the optimal regime of qualitative and quantitative analysis</p>
