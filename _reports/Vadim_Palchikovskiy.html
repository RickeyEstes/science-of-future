<p>The environmental noise of airplanes is one of the key questions in competitiveness estimation of perspective airplanes because ecological requirements have the second place in actual problems just after the safety flight requirements. The trials of aviation noise reduction methods on the base of actual objects are expensive procedure therefore they are implemented in laboratory conditions. Important part to fulfill these studies in a laboratory is presence of anechoic chamber. At this stage of the chamber creation the authors have determined: geometry and position of main constructional and switching elements of the chamber; material, design and bonding technique of anechoic plating; intake-outtake air jet system and its geometrical and power characteristics. Design of adjacent premises of acoustic laboratory is also executed. The chamber will be equipped with modern multichannel system of acquisition and data analysis operating in real-time mode. In the chamber the facilities will be placed to identify modal structure of noise generated by loudspeakers (simulation of aviation engine fan operation), to identify noise sources of flux jet and of interaction of jet with rigid body, to study noise generation mechanisms by vortex ring etc.</p>
