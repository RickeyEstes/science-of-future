<p>Silica is one of the most abundant mineral on Earth. Its importance in science and industry derives from myriad technological uses in a diversity of fields, such as ceramics and glasses, foundry, abrasives and sand blasting, catalysis, in optical fiber communications and many others [1].</p>
<p>Understanding how the properties of silica lead to its health effects is particularly important, because exposures to crystalline silica represent a serious occupational health hazards [2]. Respirable crystalline silica has been associated with increased risk of pulmonary and immune diseases [3] and cancer [4]. Intake of respirable silica particles brings them in contact with tissues, cells, and biomolecules of the lung.

<p>Therefore we test a hypothesis that peroxide species can be formed on quartz's surfaces and they may cause cancer and other deseases. To confirm this assumption the most abundant surfaces of -quartz (1-11), (011), (10-1) has been investigated using the evolutionary algorithms. Peroxide and ozone species was observed on this surfaces. Also stable structures of this surfaces were predicted.</p>
