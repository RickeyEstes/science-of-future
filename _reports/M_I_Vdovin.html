<p>The most important factor that determine dynamics of tropical storms and polar mesocyclones over the sea are interaction of the atmospheric boundary layer with a rough surface of the seas and oceans. The main characteristics of this interaction are fluxes of momentum and heat. In numerical weather and climate models they are parameterized through the dimensionless exchange coefficients (like surface drag coefficient CD and sensible heat transfer coefficient or the Stanton number Ch). This paper investigates the characteristics of air flow (up to 35 m/s) and wind waves (including severe wind conditions with breaking waves and the spray near the surface).</p>
