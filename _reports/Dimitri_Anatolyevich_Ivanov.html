<p>Designing the topology of the fluid phase in nano-structured liquids is a key factor for a variety of practical applications ranging from drug delivery to membrane technology. Supramolecular assembly of low-molecular-weight compounds is a convenient tool to generate a diversity of structures that can be suitable for creating ion-selective membranes.</p>
<p>A novel wedge-shaped amphiphilic molecule bearing a sulfonate group at the tip is found to exhibit humidity-induced phase transitions from hexagonal columnar structure to bicontinuous cubic phases [1,2]. The mesophases can be arrested by photo-polymerization of acrylic end-groups resulting in free-standing membranes with different topology of ionic nano-channels. The obtained membranes with well-ordered ionic-channel structure hold promise for applications in separation and catalysis.</p>
