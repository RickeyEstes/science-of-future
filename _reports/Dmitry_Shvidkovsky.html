<p>The future architecture is hardly thinkable without sustainability - the quality that means tolerance to nature and history, to the beauty of the world in its diversity and maximum saving of resources and space. Today sustainable architecture is lacking artistic features, which, we think, may be borrowed in future from the classic architectural method. Our basic theses are: 1) the ideas implied by the sustainability concept, were well known in the past and constitute sum and substance of the architectural classics; 2) these ideas should be interpreted in the terms corresponding to the age of globalization, multiculturalism and digital culture; 3) interpreted this way the classical ideas lay down the targets of the future sustainable development of architecture. We try to implement this concept to architectural theory, which may serve for building the future environmental science.</p>
