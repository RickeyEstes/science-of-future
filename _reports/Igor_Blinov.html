<p>A new method for finding electronic structure and wavefunctions is introduced. To obtain results it uses slightly modified Shrodinger equation for solving it in spaces which dimension is higher than dimension of physical space.</p>
<p>It gives an ability to get exact results for quasicrystal without expensive calculations. New method tested on one-dimensional quasiperiodic screened Coulomb potential.</p>
