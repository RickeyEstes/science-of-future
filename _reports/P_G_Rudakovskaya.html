<p>Magnetic nanoparticles based on iron oxides are promising materials for the biomedicine and pharmacology due to the high specific magnetization and the possibility of functionalization of the surface. Iron Oxide nanoparticles can be offered as drugs, such as a tumor - selective MRI contrast agents. Various materials based on magnetic nanoparticles may be used to the targeted delivery of anticancer drugs and to local hyperthermia therapy method. In this paper were synthesized by chemical methods magnetite nanoparticles having a spherical shape, magnetite nanorods and nanocubes.<br> 
Core-shell nanoparticles deserve a special attention between different nanoparticles, due to the possibility of combining the properties of multiple materials in a single particle. In this work we synthesized and investigated the properties of hybrid magnetite nanoparticles coated with gold shell.<br>
The resulting materials were examined using transmission electron microscopy, DLS method, measuring the size of nanoparticles on their trajectory analysis (Method NTA), also were examined magnetic properties.
