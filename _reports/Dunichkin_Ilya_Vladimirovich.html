<p>The new typology of marine facilities deals with the problem of offshore oil and gas fields’ infrastructure usage after their elimination. The influence of climate on offshore structures and the authorities’ requirements in the matter of natural environment protection create huge costs for oil and gas companies, if the abandoned platform will be at sea, fig. 1.</p>

<p>The concept of oil platform reconstruction with the change of functionhas allowedto create theoretical model of offshore structure, taking into account climate and to identify the most relevant functions for the reconstructed objects. It has led to the following basic groups of architectural typology:</p>
<p>Group 1. Production function (RES power plants, hydroponic and luminaries plantations, etc.).</p>
<p>Group 2. Socio-production function (oceanographic research, monitoring, rescue center, sea tourism, etc.).</p>
<p>The research allows to gain in perspective valuable results that may be applied to the design of new oil and gas offshore platforms taking into account their further conversion after the stage of production.</p>
