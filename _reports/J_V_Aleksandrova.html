<p>It is known that the main component of synthetic high-octane motor fuel - alkylate, receive by isobutane alkylation by various olefins on the zeolitcontaining catalysts (ZC). However a problem of such catalysts is process of fast deactivation.<br>
In this work the structure and parameters of synthesis modified ZC on the zeolites like NaY, CaET, CaEH, their combinations with Ni3+ is optimized, physical and chemical, structural and strength properties are investigated. It is established that isobutane conversion on the ZC of HY-Al-Zr synthesized by method of cationic exchange, makes 98,5% (the fractions of C5-C8 in alkylate ~ 82,7%mas.) that testifies to prospects of further researches.</p>
