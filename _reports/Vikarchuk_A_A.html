<p>Metal catalysts are widely used in chemical, petrochemical, gas processing industries and ecology. The most perspective here can be nanocatalysts made of nano- and microparticles with developed surface of base metals and metal oxides deposited on the supports in the form of metal meshes, ribbons and spirals.</p>
<p>The novelty of the approach lies in the fact that fundamentally new nanocatalysts with the developed surface can be processed from icosahedral small particles (ISP). The manufacturing process is carried out with inexpensive, simple and reliable equipment ensure the fulfillment of two major operations: (i) growing micron size ISP with a large stored elastic energy on the support in the form of steel or titanium mesh by electrodeposition of metal from the electrolyte solution; (ii) annealing the samples in order to consolidate the particles and to form pores and nanowhiskers (with density 1010 - 1011 cm-2) on their surfaces. As a result, the specific surface area of the materials increases by orders of magnitude.</p>
