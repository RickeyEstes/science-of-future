<p>Latrepirdine (also known as dimebolin and sold as Dimebon), is an antihistamine drug. It has been shown that latrepirdine inhibits brain cell death in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Research suggests it may also have cognition-enhancing effects in healthy individuals, in the absence of neurodegenerative disease pathology. However, because of negative results in human clinical trials, the drug remains unlicensed for any neurodegenerative condition.</p>
<p>Latrepirdine appears to operate through multiple mechanisms of action, both blocking the action of neurotoxic beta-amyloid proteins and inhibiting L-type calcium channels.</p>
<p>We believe that a structurally similar to latrepirdine hexahydrobenzodiazoninol derivatives are also a promising branch of bioactive compounds currently uninvestigated.</p>
<p>Based on virtual molecular docking, several hexahydrobenzodiazoninol derivatives were shown to exhibit antitumor activity. These compounds can be used as convenient starting points or intermediates in the synthesis of a wide range of structurally diverse potential medicines. We designed structures of some of these compounds and synthesized them using tetrahydrocarboline oxidation reaction. A thorough search across the resulting compounds has revealed a range of hexahydrobenzodiazoninol with promising anticancer activity. These compounds are supposed to have highly active MDM2/p53 protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors. In vitro validation is scheduled as a next step of our research.</p>
