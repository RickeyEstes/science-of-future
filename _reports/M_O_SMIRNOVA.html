<p>Ultra-High Energy Cosmic rays produce Extensive Air Showers (EAS) on surface of the Earth. Primarily for observation and registration EAS ground high energy particle detectors and atmospheric fluorescence telescopes are used. Alternative method for detection air showers particles is application bi-static radar detection system that implemented in Telescope Array Radar (TARA), in Western Utah. This experiment co-located with the Telescope Array, the “conventional” cosmic ray detector.</p>
<p>In this report equipment system and its parameters that used in experiment is presented. Characteristics receiver and transmitter antennas are measured. For electrical signal processing electronics module was developed and produced. For monitoring and control of experiment equipment and data acquisition remote station was produced. Software for data analysis from experiment is developing</p>
