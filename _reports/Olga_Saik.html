<p>The reconstruction of genetic network controlling feeding behavior (FB) and thermoregulation may give a deeper view of molecular-genetic basis of FB abnormalities and may be useful for designing new pharmacological approaches for the treatment of human diseases. In this work we performed compellation of Human Gene Networks Controlling Feeding Behavior and thermoregulation using various information sources (Entrez Gene, OMIM, UCSC Genome Browser Database, Pubmed, Coremine, DAVID, etc.).<br><br>
The compellation includes 424 human genes and their functional relationships. The genomic locations of human genes controlling FB were analyzed. In total, 17 genomic regions containing 3 genes within 1 Mb and 13 genomic regions containing 4 genes within 2 Mb were revealed.<br><br>
It was found that genes controlling FB have lower RVIS values than genes from the whole genome dataset demonstrating their decreased tolerance to functional genetic variation and reflecting the impact of purifying selection on these genes. Genes were prioritized according to their genomic characteristics and various structural and functional features of encoded proteins.<br><br>
