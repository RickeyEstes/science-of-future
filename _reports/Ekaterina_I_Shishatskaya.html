<p>The Laboratory has been working at the Siberian Federal University since December 2010. A team headed by Prof. Anthony Sinskey is capable of conducting integrated research including polymer synthesis, construction of high-technology devices, and biomedical trials. The Laboratory occupies a special building, which accommodates a polymer pilot production facility and a number of research laboratories equipped with state-of-the-art devices. Young scientists comprise 50% of the team. Publications relating to the project in 2010-2013 include 3 monographs and over 50 papers in peer-reviewed international and leading Russian journals; 5 candidate of science and 3 doctor of science degrees have been awarded; 59 Specialists, 37 Bachelors, and 22 Masters have got their degrees. The outcome of the project is the scientific basis and experimental foundation for practical application of the promising type of biomaterials to be used in novel biomedical technologies.</p>
