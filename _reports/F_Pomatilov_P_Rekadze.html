<p>Gear pumps are widely used in different industries due to their simple construction, cheap cost, ease of maintenance and et.al. They are often associated with noise and vibration. </p>
<p>The article focuses on this problem. </p>
<p>Previous researches shows that it is possible to replace several parts of gear pumps to polymeric ones. This substitution leads to cost and noise reduction of the pump unit. On the test rig built up for this purpose, series of experiments were carry-out. </p>
<p>Serious difficulties were encountered with the plastic pinion shafts testing. On several tests the plastic pinion shaft was destroyed.</p>
<p>Results of experiment shows that vibroacoustic characteristics of the pump unit strongly depend on different material drive and driven rotor. These tests also were performed under various operating conditions. Experimental results indicate that replacing metal pinion shafts to polymeric lead to acoustic noise, vibration and pulsations of pump unit reducing on the test modes. </p>
