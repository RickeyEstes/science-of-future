<p>Recombinant immunotoxins (RI) are genetically engineered proteins composed of targeting and toxic modules. The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is an advanced molecular target for a targeted therapy of cancer which overexpression characterizes many types of solid tumors.<br><br>
The goal of this research was to produce a novel RI comprising HER2-specific DARPin (targeting module) and fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (toxic module) and to estimate its properties.<br><br>
The created RI has been shown to bind with HER2-positive cells and to have profound cytotoxic effect on them. In vivo monitoring of HER2-overexpressing tumor growth revealed that the RI causes pronounced inhibition of tumor growth. Our results testify to high potential of novel RI for targeted therapy of HER2-overexpressing tumors.<br><br>
