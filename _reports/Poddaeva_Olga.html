<p>Relevance of the topic is connected with the ever rising requirements of normative documents on the reliability of unique buildings and structures under the influence of wind loads. Contemporary standards require physical modeling in specialized wind tunnel (Fig. 1).</p>

<p>Physical experiment in preparation involves the design and creation of a model of the object. During the classical aerodynamic experiment basic parameter of modeling - geometrical similarity of model to the natural object. Layout design technique must provide reproduction of individual architectural elements in the scale selected depending on the size of the working area used wind tunnel (Fig. 2), as well as placement of the measuring equipment.</p>

<p>A separate question is the design of aeroelastic models - models of "flexible" structures (bridges, towers, chimneys, etc.). The uniqueness of design techniques such models described in this report, due to the high complexity of the reproduction mass-inertial and frequency characteristics of the real object.</p>
