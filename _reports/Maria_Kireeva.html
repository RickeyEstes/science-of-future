<p>Hydrological regime on European Russia transforms drastically answering recent climate changes. Rivers here used to be traditionally attributed to the East-European type with well-pronounced seasonal flood wave. Statistical and spatial analysis of data from 300 gauging stations reveals strong reduction in seasonal flood volume, especially in the west (>40% and 15-30% for the Don River and Volga River basins, correspondingly) whereas relatively stable flood volume is detected for the eastern rivers (Kama, Ural). These changes are mainly due to increase of cold period temperature. Seasonal flood reduction is widely accompanied by increase in low flow by 20â€“60%. Hence, natural runoff regulation is found out to increase dramatically. Despite this fact, a lot of scientists assume that variability and frequency of extreme events tend to rise. During the last years extreme flood events, caused by enormous precipitation, occurred in Black Sea region. In 2010 and 2014 widely-spread hydrological draught resulted in limitation of water consumption for residents and industry. Thus, increase in natural runoff regulation does not reduce frequency of extreme events.</p>
