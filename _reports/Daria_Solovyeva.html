<p>The processes of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) interactions with purple membranes (PM) containing bacteriorhodopsin (BRh) were studied by the absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman and SERS spectroscopy. The presence of PM suppresses the forming of AgNPs aggregates which are necessary for SERS. It determines low value of SERS enhancement factor. It was shown that enhancement of Raman signal has electromagnetic nature. Comparison of the optical spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy data allows to suppose that SERS-spectra arise from the BRh localized in so called “hot spots”, which are formed by AgNPs aggregation caused by incubation with SERS-activator. SERS-spectroscopy shows, that Ag NPs modify the BRh structure localized in the “hot spots”. Their structures close to dark-adapted BR548 form, contains 13-cis retinal with cis-C=N fragment. It was found that this type of Ag NPs impact suppresses the BRh’s photocycle.</p>
