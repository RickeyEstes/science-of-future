<p>Post-Soviet society is under contradictory influence of democratic transit trends, which suppose creating of reflexive civil identity and ethnical and cultural mobilization, which is followed by intensification of ethnical and confessional identification. This contradiction between post-traditional and traditional identity models is often interpreted as potential conflict source.<br>
During sociological research realization to study population identities transformations and their influence on interethnic relations in Southern Siberia republics in 2013 it was discovered: 1) identity of modern Russians is contradictory symbiosis of new civil identity and identification concepts of past (ethnicity, Soviet citizenship etc.); 2) existence and stability of tensity in interethnic relations is determined by wide range of factors (economical, political etc.), but therefore they have a character of objective contradiction. Identities traditionalization, when taking integrative civil identity strengthening trend into account, can not become interethnic tensity escalation factor in near future.</p>
