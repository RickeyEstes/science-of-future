<p>In general, Monte Carlo (MC) method together with particle-in-cell (PIC) method allows one to simulate evolution of a distribution function with creation of new particles incorporated. In the case of relativistic charged particles emitted high-energy gamma-quanta specific difficulties arises. In this report we present a highly-efficient PIC+MC code notably appropriate for extreme laser plasmas simulation with hard photon emission and pair creation taken into account.</p>
