<p>As one of the main components of terrestrial ecosystem, soil plays a major role in maintaining atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. Results of GHG flux monitoring measurements in the representative natural and agrogenic-changed ecosystems (virgin steppe, 5- and 10-year rotational mowed steppe, forest, pasture and fallow land) of the Central Chernozem Reserve are presented. CO2 fluxes have been measured in-situ by infrared gas analyzer Li-820, while N2O and CH4 – by original exposition chamber under LAMP modification (RF patent # 2518979) and gas chromatograph. Average CO2 fluxes ranged between 9.9 – 44.4 g CO2 m-2 day-1 with good correlation to soil temperature (0.74) and moisture (0.56). СН4 fluxes are characterized by uptake in natural ecosystems and emission in agrogenic-changed ones. Average CH4 fluxes varied from -0.14 to 0.6 mg CH4 m-2 day-1 with a significant correlation to soil moisture (r= 0.69). N2O fluxes fluctuated between -0.27 to 1.2 mg N2O m-2 day-1. The obtained models of GHG flux dynamics due to soil temperature and moisture variability allow us to predict GHG changes depending on the season and land-use changes.</p>
