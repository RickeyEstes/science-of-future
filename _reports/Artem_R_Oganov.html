<p>The development of powerful structure prediction methods and codes, such as our USPEX code [1-3] enables prediction of materials with superior or unusual properties. I will discuss several thrusts of our recent work and related fundamental questions:</p>
<p>A. Search for superhard and ultrahard materials. Discovery of new ultrahard phases (e.g. MnB3 [4]) in apparently well-studied systems at normal conditions. Phase diagram of the elusive C-N system [5]. Can a material harder than diamond exist? [6,7].</p>
<p>B. Low-dimensional systems. New techniques have been developed to deal with surfaces, 2D-crystals, polymers. Recently, we made discovered two new high-permittivity polymers [8], and predicted a 2D boron crystal, much more stable than previous proposals and having massless Dirac fermions [9].</p>
<p>C. Search for exotic chemistry, which produces unusual materials.</p>
<p>Recently, we predicted a new hydrogen hydrate H2O*2H2 (i.e. H6O) to be stable at pressures above 38 GPa [10]; having 18 wt.% of easily removable hydrogen, this could be an ideal energy storage material if one can find a way of stabilizing it at normal conditions.</p>
<p>More intriguingly, we have discovered a class of “impossible” chemical compounds – such as Na3Cl, Na2Cl, Na3Cl2, NaCl3, NaCl7 [11] – to become stable under pressure. More recently, we predicted some of such compounds, e.g. KCl3, to be stable at normal conditions [12]. KCl3 can find industrial use as a chlorine storage material.</p>
<p>I will also discuss our recent discovery of stable compounds of helium at experimentally reachable pressures - Na2He and Na2HeO [13].</p>
