<p>An “international style” was born as a result of complex debate on form and style within the avant-garde movement in the early decades of the 20th century.<br>
The new style was based on Kazimir Malevich's concept of art and creativity, the reality being not the object to be depicted but the thing to be re-created and transformed. He used elementary geometric forms and a very limited range of painting techniques. After centuries of refining and semantic sophistication artistic form, in Malevich's interpretation, was back to its origin . His artistic form has no object, function or meaning related to ethnic, local or personal aspects of culture. Art is an international means of communication, a form of global language, in his view. Thus, thanks to Malevich, a notion of style was broadened to denote a model to construct a system of painting. To this day, his views underlie the propaedeutics in all branches of three-dimensional art .</p>
