<p>A new wave theory of thin-walled beams of open profile with Cosserat-type microstructure has been developed based on the approach proposed in [1] for pre-stressed spatially curved elastic thin-walled beams of open profile. The aim of the authors is to create the theory of propagation of transient waves (surfaces of strong discontinuity) in thin-walled beams of open profile, which should be quite different from Timoshenko-like theories, resulting in the data comparable with those corresponding to transient wave propagation in the 3D Cosserat continuum. The proposed theory takes transverse shear deformations, rotary inertia and variations in thin-walled beam’s width into account, and it is based only on physical and mechanical characteristics of the material without any additional correction coefficients.</p>
