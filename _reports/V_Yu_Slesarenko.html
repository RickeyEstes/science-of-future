<p>Nanoglass state is a new noncrystalline state of alloys, which may be characterized by very peculiar microstructure. Instead of well-known amorphous structure, nanoglasses consist of amorphous nano-sized clusters separated by amorphous interfaces. As far as mechanical and physical properties strongly depend on the microstructure, it is very important to carry out accurate study of the behavior of such new materials. Nowadays nanoglass state may mainly be produced by methods of inert-gas condensation and magnetron sputtering. Unfortunately, these techniques can be used only to obtain very small volumes of the materials and it is almost impossible to study mechanical behavior of nanoglasses. At the same time, there are several premises, which allow one to assume, that nanoglass state may be produced by means of severe plastic deformation (SPD). For example, it was shown that relatively high density of shear bands may be formed during SPD. Under conditions when nanocrystallization is suppressed, these shear bands may result in the atomic structure changes and the obtained structure may be similar to the “classical” nanoglasses. In this current study we are trying to develop the approach for producing nanoglass structure on the basis of initially amorphous TiNiCu melt-spun ribbons, subjected to high pressure torsion under the several thermal regimes.</p>
