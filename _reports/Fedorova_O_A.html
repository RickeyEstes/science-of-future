<p>The p53 protein and its two homologues p63 and p73 are transcriptional factors regulating activation of numerous genes expression. These proteins in exposure to different stimuli participate in various biological events, including regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, DNA reparation, and apoptosis. We studied p53 influence on expression of an orphan nuclear receptor NR4A3. Using qPCR we showed growth of NR4A3 mRNA in p53 overexpression. Using Western blot analysis we demonstrated that p53 also upregulates protein level of NR4A3. Since that we concluded that p53 bears influence on expression of NR4A3. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) we demonstrated the physical interaction of p53 with response elements of NR4A3 promoter. Finally, using luciferase assay we confirmed ability of p53 to affect NR4A3 transcription directly. This makes us conclude that NR4A3 is a novel transcriptional target of p53, and activation of p53 directly results in growth of NR4A3. It is known that in some cancer cell the level of NR4A3 is increased, and understanding of its biological role may provide pharmacological applications.
