<p>The Laboratory was founded at MAI by the order of the MAI rector of November 15, 2010. The program of the laboratory is aimed at the research and development creation of radio-frequency ion thrusters (RIT) that will improve performance of spacecraft of next generation.</p>
<p>During the relatively short period of its existence the Laboratory conducted deep modernization of test facilities, mastered technology of RIT, development and testing, developed a set of physical and mathematical models of processes in RIT, based on which the numerical modeling was made. The RIT laboratory models are developed and retest.</p>
<p>The analysis of RIT application for missions to asteroids, the inner and outer planets of the solar system and their natural satellites was made.</p>
<p>In cooperation with the leading companies in the space industry the Laboratory team is involved in the implementation of the Federal Space Program of the Russian Federation for the years 2006 - 2015.</p>
<p>The Laboratory staff are actively involved in the implementation of a large number of R & D on the subject of the research and are regularly trained. The results of the staff work were presented at international and national conferences, scientific seminars and roundtables.</p>
