<p>FTIR studies of surface processes on dispersed metal halides.</p>
<p>Metal halide surfaces are used as catalytic supports, as insulators for nanoelectronics, or optoelectronic components as themselves. Since academician Terenin brought the topic of surface photoprocesses into focus, metal halides have been used as model systems in the studies of active surface sites. Folman et al.[1, 2] have investigated porous crystalline films of alkali halides by means of IR spectroscopy and associated the observed band splitting in the spectra of adsorbed CO with different orientation of adsorbed molecules. Further investigations of annealed films and cleaved crystals by Ewing et al. [3] have shown that these bands are due to adsorption on different sites. Atoms on kinks and steps of crystalline lattice are coordinatively unsaturated, and were shown to account for stronger adsorption.</p>
<p>The band maxima of adsorbed CO slightly move with the increasing surface coverage to lower wavenumbers. Using the method of isotopic dilution Zecchina & Scarano [4] have shown that as in the case of oxide surfaces this is caused by two kinds of lateral interaction between the adsorbed molecules. The downward static shift is partially compensated by the dynamic dipole-dipole interaction, which shifts the observed frequencies to higher wavenumbers. The manifestations of resonance dipole-dipole interaction were observed by us even for symmetric non-polar molecules such as SF6 or CF4 adsorbed on metal fluorides. The band of the most intense n3 vibration for the layer of adsorbed molecules becomes split into distinct components corresponding to delocalized modes parallel or perpendicular to the surface. Additional complexity of the spectra was brought about by the presence of different surface sites.</p>
<p>Modern trend to nanofabrication requires detailed information on the properties of the defects sites of crystal lattice surfaces, both native, such as ribs and kinks of microparticles, or impurity centers, like admixed oxygen atoms or hydroxyl groups. The latter sites of fluorides were extensively studied in the works by Wojciechowska and co-workers [5-7]. Recent data on low-temperature CO adsorption by Wuttke et al. [8, 9] and in our laboratory provided more detailed data about the properties and localization of these sites.</p>
<p>In order to study surface properties of alkali halides we have developed a technique of salt film deposition onto a support cooled with liquid nitrogen. The technique enables us to prepare porous films with specific surface area of around 200 m2/g. Such films have a high concentration of defect sites, which we investigated by FTIR spectra of adsorbed CO and other gases.</p>
<p>The properties of these defect centers are shown to differ much from those existing on regular crystal planes. Besides the greater electron-acceping ability, reflected in a substantial high-frequency shifts of adsorbed CO (for NaCl from 2143 up to 2170 cm-1, against 2153 cm-1 for regular sites of (100) plane), these sites were shown to reveal linkage isomerism i.e. are capable of interacting with adsorbed CO molecule both via carbon or oxygen atom.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of linkage isomerism of adsorbed molecules, first established for CO - alkali cation complexes in some Y- and ZSM-5 zeolites, was not found on oxides or X zeolites. This was explained by electrostatic model as a result of strong interaction of molecule with the surrounding oxygen atoms. Our DFT calculations of cluster models of NaCl confirmed this conclusion, predicted the existence of two potential wells of CO bound to Na+ with the adsorption and isomerisation energies close to the experimentally measured values and enabled us to estimate the height of potential barriers between the two states.</p>
<p>Photoinduced processes on metal halides are of a great interest for the heterogeneous chemistry of atmosphere, since sea aerosol particles play important role in the balance of small atmospheric constituents. To this end we have investigated some photocatalytical reactions on the surfaces, adsorption and photoreactions of ozone. The experiments on photosorption of simple gases are in progress.</p>
