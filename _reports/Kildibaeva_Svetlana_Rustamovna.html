<p>According to the acoustic views under specific temperature and pressure conditions, surfacing of methane bubbles from the bottom of the ocean accompanied by the formation of hydrate on the surface of the bubbles. This paper considers mathematical model of the dome trap, designed for the collection of gas hydrates on the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Suppose on the ocean floor there is a source gas from which to some known mass flow Mg emittedmethane bubbles entering into the cold water with temperature Tl, thus forming streams of bubbles.Under the proposed scheme over the source of gas under the ocean set dome trap (figure 1).It has the form of a cylinder, the top side of the dome is closed and gas enters through the lower side.</p>
<p>Dependence of the thermo physical parameters of the time. It is established that there is a minimal thickness of the hydrated layer for fixed dimensions of the dome, which may accumulate inside the dome.</p>
