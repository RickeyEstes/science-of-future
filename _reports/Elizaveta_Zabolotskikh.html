<p>The new Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard the GCOM-W1 satellite has 4 C-band channels working around 7 GHz. These low frequency measurements can be effectively used both for rain rate estimation and rain brightness temperature calculation for C- and X-band channels. After separation of the atmospheric rain radiance from the total brightness temperature of the atmosphere-ocean system, sea surface wind speed (SWS) is possible to be retrieved from AMSR2 data as if it were no rain, using the retrieval algorithms, developed earlier for non-rain conditions using physical modeling of brightness temperatures. The suggested approach has been applied to more than 100 typhoons and hurricanes for 2012-2013 years including Haiyan case. Sea surface wind speeds retrieved from AMSR2 have been compared with those from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) instrument. High correlation has been detected indicating the great potential of AMSR2 SWS retrievals in hurricanes.</p>
