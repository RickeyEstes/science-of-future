<p>In the past decade gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been widely used in various biomedical applications [1]. Multifunctional nanocomposites that combine therapeutic, diagnostic, and sensing modalities in a single nanostructure are widely used in a new field of nanobiotechnology called theranostics. Although the term “theranostics” has been introduced quite recently, it is now rapidly growing and promising field at the crossroads of plasmonics and nanomedicine. In this talk we summarize our recent efforts in analytical and theranostic applications of engineered GNPs and nanocomposites by using plasmonic properties of GNPs and various optical techniques [2]. Specifically, we provide examples of combined photodynamic and photothermal treatment of pathogenic bacteria and xenografted tumors; materno-embryonic transfer of GNPs in pregnant rats.<br>
