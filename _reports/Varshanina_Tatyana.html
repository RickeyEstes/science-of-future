<p>The idea that it is necessary to create a multi-parametrical model of a course of natural processes approached to reality for forecasting natural processes on the basis of tool supervision is wrong.These data are reflection of one of uncountable variants of combined and interfering power influences rather than of the whole complex.</p>
<p>The method of a structural mask of power geographical fields provides new opportunities of forecasting natural risk.</p>
<p>The method is based on the solution of the inverse problem of structure restoration of space-planetary power fields generating geographical objects in focus of the Earthâ€™s surface through calculation of parameter gradients forming the structure of geographical objects.</p>
<p>This method allows us to build effective models of forecasting.</p>
