<p>Within a framework of development of predictive theory of noise generation in turbulent flow the piston vortex ring generator is designed. Existent and perspective designs of vortex ring generation facility are analyzed. It is determined that most easy-to-use facility forming vortex rings in wide range of parameters is a generator possessing percussion mechanism, piston stroke control system, sound-absorbent lining and damping the generator spurious modes. Distinctive feature of the developed generator design from existent ones is low level of structural self-noise due to reduction of metal parts quantity and wide use of damping materials. It is proposed to use 3-D printer technology for production such parts as a case, a changeable nozzle etc. The most friction parts are covered with chafing-plates; all impact areas have rubber inserts and seals. For the selected design the geometry features are worked out in detail; calculation of percussion mechanism and strength is made. For the geometry features of the developed generator the numerical simulation of vortex ring forming under piston shock loading is carried out. The computations are performed about next turbulence models: k-Îµ, SST, LES. Influence of the turbulence models on solution accuracy is estimated by the comparison of computed results with experimental data existing in papers. The obtained results confirm the theory that inner geometry of the generator influences slightly on the process of vortex ring forming.</p>
