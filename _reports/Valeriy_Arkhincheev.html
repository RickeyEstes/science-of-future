<p>As well known the modern electronics passes to the nanosizes as 10 nanometers of chip. Upon transition to such sizes of functional elements the two essential issues, connected with delay of a signal transmission on the lines and with of good isolation of chips at dense packing have appeared. For solution of the interconnect problem at dense packing of elements of chips metals with a low resistance (Cu instead of Al) are used and for isolation problem the low-k dielectrics instead of traditional SiO2 are used. Such dielectrics have nanoporous structure andporosity essentially changes many chemical and physical properties of materials as heat conductivity and its temporal degradation due to penetration of chemicals, etc. In this regard essential efforts of researchers are directed to prevention of undesirable consequences heat and a mass transfer in these materials. It should be noted that the experimental study of these processes doesn't give a complete description of processes and doesn't allow to predict the new problems arising at scaling of the critical sizes of functional elements. So in this report we apply method of fractional calculus for a study the diffusion processes and describe new features of diffusion and capture of active spices in a such nanoporous martterials.</p>
