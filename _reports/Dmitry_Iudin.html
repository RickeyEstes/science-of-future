<p>Atmospheric boundary layer is characterized by a variety of physical phenomena, including the processes of generation and transfer of charged particles â€“ ions and charged aerosols and hydrometeors. These electrical processes occur simultaneously with aerodynamical processes and can serve as a useful means for their diagnostics. Complex electrical measurements with the use of sodar data show that electric field pulsation analysis is useful for atmospheric turbulence and convection monitoring both in unstable and stable planetary boundary layer (PBL). In particular, the number of aeroelectric structures generated per hour is a convenient measure of the turbulence intensity. Pulsation spectra contain the information on the boundary layer height. Different approaches to the modeling of Global Electric Circuit generators with particular focus on the planetary boundary layer, or Austausch, generator, operating in the fair weather regions, have been developed. An analytical expression for the ionospheric potential induced by the convective current is suggested. The obtained expression shows that convection amplifies the contributions of thunderstorm/shower-cloud sources, while the value of this amplification varies likely from 10 to 20% depending on the square occupied by intensive convection, mean thickness of the boundary layer, and characteristics of the air column resistance without convection. The basic equations of classical electrode effect theory are obtained for some classes of solutions within the framework of this approach. Correct formulations of the problems have been given. New classes of solutions were described. The model complication and allowance for the PBL height, speed profile and distribution of charges over the probe sources will be a topic of further theoretical studies, together with their coupling with experimental data for the PBL characterization and the development of new methods of its operative diagnostics.</p>
