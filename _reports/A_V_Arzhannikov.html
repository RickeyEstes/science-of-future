<p>In the project novel schemes to generate mm- and sub-mm wave radiation by high power beams and the application of strong microwaves were investigated:</p>
<p>1.	Generation of sub-mm EM radiation in plasmas on the basis of plasmon-plasmon merging</p>
<p>2.	Generation of sub-mm EM radiation on the basis of a two-stage scheme in a planar free electron maser (FEM)</p>
<p>3.	Development of novel quasi â€“ optical components and systems for the diagnostics of sub-mm-wave radiation</p>
<p>4.	Application of high power microwaves for Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) of fusion plasmas in a magnetic mirror device</p>
<p>5.	Microwave processing for production of novel materials, e.g. sintering of nano-ceramics or metal-powder compounds, novel methods for production of carbon materials, and microwave processing in an-organic and organic chemistry.</p>

<p>In December 2012 the financial support of the project was ended but we are continuing the research work on its topics. All the scientific and technical achievements have been summarized in the report.</p>
