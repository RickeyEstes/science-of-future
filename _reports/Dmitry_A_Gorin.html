<p>Theranostics is a term composed from two words: therapy and diagnostics, and could be applied to describe that in the framework of a similar technology diagnostics and therapy are provided [1]. New directions of theranostics can be connected with nanostructured microsized object applications. There are microcapsules [2-4] and core-shell structures [5,6]. Nanostructured microcapsules with remote controlled properties provided by some external influences, as laser irradiation [2], magnetic field [3], and ultrasound [4] were fabricated. Recently, it was shown the possibility to create a nanostructured SERS platform based on core-shell for studies of the chemical composition inside living cells [5]. The new type of object can be named satellite that can be used for studies of the microworld inside living organisms and their treatment on the cellular level and also for monitoring of implant/tissue interfaces [5,6]. These ideas have good perspectives for application in medicine. The creation of such type of objects requires a multidisciplinary approach which connects the knowledge of physics and chemistry of colloids, interfaces and biophysics. This study was supported by grant №14.Z50.31.0004.</p>
