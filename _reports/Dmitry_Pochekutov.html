<p>The amoeba of a complex hypersurface is its image under a logarithmic projection. 
A number of properties of algebraic hypersurface amoebas are carried over to the 
case of transcendental hypersurfaces. We demonstrate the potential that amoebas
can bring into statistical physics by considering the problem of energy distribution in a quantum thermodynamic ensemble. The spectrum of the ensemble is assumed to be multidimensional; this leads us to the notions of a multidimensional temperature and a vector of differential thermodynamic forms. Strictly speaking, in the report we represent the development of the multidimensional Darwin and Fowler method and give the description of the domain of admissible average values of energy for which the thermodynamic limit exists.</p>
