<p>A distinctive feature of the soil environment in comparison with the building materials is their dispersion, heterogeneity and multi-component (solid particles, liquid, gas). On the stress-strain state of such an environment is significantly influenced by power, physical (temperature, humidity, etc..) And dynamic effects. On sandy soils particularly significant impact vibration effects, which arise as a result of significant additional shear deformation and displacement in time (creep, vibrocreep). Especially strong is the effect manifests itself in water-saturated fine-grained sand, which occurs as a result of loss of the bearing capacity of the base and the transition to solid ground in the fluid state (vibration).<br><br>
The report presents the results of experimental tests of sandy soils in not saturated and saturated state under triaxial compression at different vibration effects (frequency, amplitude). Show a significant effect of frequency, amplitude and degree of saturation on the dynamic stability. Also provides calculated-theoretical justification of these experimental results on the basis of consideration of the various models of sandy soil.
