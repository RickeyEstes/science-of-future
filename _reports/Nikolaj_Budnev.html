<p>The Tunka-HiSCORE concept aims at gamma-ray astronomy beyond 10 TeV and cosmic ray physics beyond 100 TeV. A prototype array of 9 Tunka-HiSCORE stations, distributed over a regular square grid of 300 m side length, is operational in the Tunka valley in Siberia since October 2013. This prototype array is the fist step towards a 1 kmÂ² wideangle non-imaging air Cherenkov array. This array will be one component of the TAIGA experiment, which will additionally comprise imaging air Cherenkov telescopes and muon detectors. In this talk, the status of the experiment, first results from the prototype array, future developments, and their physics potential will be addressed.</p>
