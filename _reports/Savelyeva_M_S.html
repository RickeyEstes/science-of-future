<p>Design of new biomimetic scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery is actual task of regenerative medicine at the present time. There is a problem of sustained release of drug from scaffold.
</p>
<p>In this work we propose the method of modification electrospun scaffold by including spherical calcium carbonate microcontainers CaCO3 into fibers.</p><p>The SEM images of received samples are shown Fig.1.</p>

<p>Fig.1. SEM images of materials with the following weigh ratio of PCL/CaCO3: 95/5 (A), 90/10 (B), 80/20 (C) and 70/30 (D).</p>
<p>To study the drug release from PCL/CaCO3, the sample with 10 % concentration of microcontainers loaded photosensitizer Photosens was prepared. The in vitro drug release behavior was monitored by spectrophotometry. The results show that the PCL/CaCO3 has a slower drug release rate in comparison with microcontainers CaCO3.</p>
