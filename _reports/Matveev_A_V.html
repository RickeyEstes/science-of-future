<p>The work is implemented as a part of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science Task, project № 33.1684.2014/К.</p>
<p>In 2013 Omsk Division of Russian Geographic Society attempted an expedition aimed at the search for the sections of the world’s longest road – the oldMoscow- Siberian Track of the</p>
<p>XVIII – the beginning of the XX centuries. As a result, there has been elaborated a procedure of discovering sections of roads of the New Age.</p>
<p>Nowadays, a corpus of cartographic sources allowing for locating the routes of the track afield is non-existent. For this reason the expedition studied the objects which undoubtedly are the sections of the track. These are the places of waftage of the XVIII – the beginning of the XX centuries over the Irtysh river, accompanied by the remnants of the artificial constructions such as conveyances (3 sections), as well as previously researched fragments of the track, recognized as the Cultural Legacy Objects (4 sections).Moreover, 3 previously unknown sections were discovered.</p>
<p>Further search for the sections of the track is possible on the basis of the analyses of the cartographic materials of the XVIII – the beginning of the XX centuries of small scale with the image of land and settlements; interviews with veterans of road construction; involvement of the satellite imagery data.</p>
