<p>Semiconductor nanocrystals have been investigated intensively. However, little attention has been paid to chirality of these objects, but it can have a tremendous effect on the nanotechnology field. If nanocrystal, whose sizes are comparable to the sizes of biomolecules and the pores of cell membranes, also possesses chirality, its «lock and key» interaction with biological objects may be possible. We investigate inherent chirality of the nanocrystals. Under assumption that as-prepared ensemble is a mixture of achiral nanocrystals and the nanocrystals with opposite chirality, we develop the method of enantioselective phase transfer, which allows partial resolution of the enantiomers by using of a chiral ligand (cysteine). At low concentration of cysteine, it is possible to achieve equal concentration of the nanocrystals in water and chloroform. The water phase displays optical activity of the nanocrystals modified by cysteine. The chloroform phase also shows optical activity. We assume that the nanocrystals in this phase possess inherent chirality, because their surfaces are not modified by chiral ligands.</p>
